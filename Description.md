## 🚀 Installation & Setup

We recommend the following manual installation method, as it makes future configuration much easier.

### For All Platforms (Windows, iOS, Android)

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest `.mcaddon` file from the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/SjnExe/AddonExe/releases).
2.  **Extract the Packs:**
    - Do **not** open the `.mcaddon` file directly. Instead, rename it to end in `.zip` (e.g., `AddonExe.mcaddon` -> `AddonExe.zip`).
    - Unzip the file. Inside, you will find two folders: `AddonExeBP` (the Behavior Pack) and `AddonExeRP` (the Resource Pack).
    - Move these two folders into your Minecraft's `behavior_packs` and `resource_packs` folders, respectively.
    > **Why this method?** Installing the folders directly makes it simple to find and edit the `config.js` file later.
3.  **Apply to Your World:**
    - Open Minecraft and go to your world's settings.
    - Apply both `AddonExeBP` and `AddonExeRP` to your world.
4.  **Enable World Settings (CRITICAL!):**
    - In your world settings, go to the "Game" section and enable **"Activate Cheats"**.
    - Next, go to the "Experiments" section and **enable the "Beta APIs" toggle.** The addon will not function without this setting.
5.  **Prioritize:** Ensure `AddonExeBP` is at the **TOP** of your behavior pack list in the world settings.

### For Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS)

Follow steps 1 & 2 above, then:
1.  **Place the Pack Folders:**
    -   Move the extracted `AddonExeBP` and `AddonExeRP` folders into your BDS's `behavior_packs` and `resource_packs` folders.
2.  **Activate the Packs:**
    -   Download the following two files from the root of the repository:
        -   [**`world_behavior_packs.json`**](world_behavior_packs.json)
        -   [**`world_resource_packs.json`**](world_resource_packs.json)
    -   Place both of these files into the root folder of your world (the same folder that contains your `level.dat`).
3.  **Enable Beta APIs:**
    -   The easiest method is to download your world, open it in a local version of Minecraft, enable the "Beta APIs" experiment, and then re-upload the world to your server.

## 👑 Initial Configuration (CRUCIAL!)

After installing, you **must** set yourself as the owner to access admin commands.

1.  Navigate to `behavior_packs/AddonExeBP/scripts/` and open `config.js` in a text editor.
2.  Find the `ownerPlayerNames` setting.
3.  Add your **exact** in-game name (case-sensitive) to the array.
    ```javascript
    // Example in AddonExeBP/scripts/config.js
    ownerPlayerNames: ['YourNameHere', 'AnotherOwnerName'],
    ```
4.  Save the file. If your server is live, run the `/reload` command in-game.
