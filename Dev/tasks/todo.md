# To-Do / Future Tasks

This list contains planned features, improvements, and areas for future investigation. When a task is started, it should be moved to `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md`.

## README Enhancements (Further Considerations)
- **Medium Priority:**
    - Consider adding a project logo/banner (requires asset). (Placeholder exists in README)
    - *(Addressed by linking to full guide) Placeholder for a more detailed `Docs/Troubleshooting.md` if common issues arise.*
- **Low Priority:**
    - *(Addressed) Dynamic Discord member count (if an easy endpoint is found).*
    - Code size/LoC badge (requires CI integration for dynamic updates or manual static updates).
    - Contributor recognition section/AllContributors bot integration.

## Feature Development
- *(Example) Implement advanced heuristics for Elytra Fly detection.*
- *(Example) Develop a new check for AutoTool/FastBreak.*

## Bug Fixes
- *(Example) Investigate reports of false positives in NoFall detection under specific conditions.*

## Documentation
*(Most example documentation tasks are now complete or significantly addressed. Future documentation would depend on new features or identified gaps.)*

## Refactoring & Maintenance
- *(Example) Review and optimize player data saving mechanisms.*
