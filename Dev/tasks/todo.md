# To-Do / Future Tasks

This list contains planned features, improvements, and areas for future investigation. When a task is started, it should be moved to `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md`.

## README Enhancements (Post-Initial Review)
- **High Priority:**
    - Add GitHub total downloads badge.
    - Add placeholders for key visuals (e.g., `!panel` UI, World Border).
    - Create a "Why Choose This AntiCheat?"/"Key Advantages" introductory section.
    - Add a placeholder for a potential video tutorial link in Quick Start.
    - Include a brief note on performance.
    - Add a small troubleshooting tip (e.g., double-check `config.js`, report issues).
    - Enhance "Contributing" section with a general encouragement and link to GitHub issues for "good first issues" (if applicable/when labels are used).
- **Medium Priority:**
    - Consider adding a project logo/banner (requires asset).
    - Placeholder for a more detailed `Docs/Troubleshooting.md` if common issues arise.
- **Low Priority:**
    - Dynamic Discord member count (if an easy endpoint is found).
    - Code size/LoC badge (requires CI integration for dynamic updates or manual static updates).
    - Contributor recognition section/AllContributors bot integration.
