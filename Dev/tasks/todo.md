# To-Do / Future Tasks

This list contains planned features, improvements, and areas for future investigation. When a task is started, it should be moved to `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md`.

## High Priority / Next Up
*No high priority tasks currently identified.*

## Medium Priority
*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   Investigate and implement more complex Killaura/Aimbot detection (e.g., analyzing hit patterns, pitch/yaw consistency).
    *   Explore checks for Scaffold, Tower, other automated building cheats.
    *   Consider checks for Timer (game speed manipulation) if possible with Script API.

## Low Priority / Ideas
*   **Performance Optimization:** Profile existing checks under load and optimize if necessary.
*   **Localization:** Consider options for localizing warning messages if the addon is intended for a multi-lingual audience.
*   **Automated Actions:** Based on flag counts, implement configurable automated actions (e.g., temp-kick, reduced player capabilities). This requires careful design to avoid false positives.

## Documentation & Workflow
*   **Task File Maintenance:** AI assistant should keep `completed.md`, `ongoing.md`, and `todo.md` current.
