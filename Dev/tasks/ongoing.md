# Ongoing Tasks
*(Date: End of Current Session)*

---
*All specific tasks assigned for this session have been addressed. Previous ongoing tasks are now documented in completed.md. This file can be used to list new tasks for a subsequent AI assistant session.*

*   **1. (Completed) Integration: Deferred Player Data Saving**
    *   This task has been completed. Details are in `completed.md`.

*   **2. (Completed) Comprehensive Optimization, Code Efficiency, and Style Review**:
    *   **Overall Objective:** Review project files to improve runtime performance (primary goal), reduce code LoC (secondary goal), and ensure adherence to coding style.
    *   **Status:** This comprehensive review objective is now complete for all targeted JavaScript files in the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/` directory.
    *   **Completed Reviews for this Objective (across all relevant sessions):**
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`: Styling and JSDoc.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/utils/playerUtils.js`: LoC reduction, styling, JSDoc.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/utils/itemUtils.js`: Styling, JSDoc, constant naming.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/playerDataManager.js`: Deferred saving refactor, caching strategy for logs & reports, constant naming, styling, JSDoc.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/main.js`: Reviewed, confirmed efficient, minor style updates.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/eventHandlers.js`: Optimized with `async` usage, robust data handling, styling, JSDoc.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/commandManager.js`: Optimized with `Map` lookups for commands, styling, JSDoc.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/uiManager.js`: Styling, JSDoc, UI flow clarity, robust command execution from UI.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/logManager.js`: Implemented in-memory caching & deferred saving, styling, JSDoc, constant naming.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/actionManager.js`: Styling, JSDoc, robust message formatting.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/rankManager.js`: Styling, JSDoc, robust error handling.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/reportManager.js`: Implemented in-memory caching & deferred saving, styling, JSDoc, constant naming.
        *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/index.js` (Barrel File): Styling, JSDoc.
        *   All check files within `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/` subdirectories (`chat`, `combat`, `movement`, `player`, `world`):
            *   Applied styling (4-space indent, JSDoc with `@file` and type imports, `camelCase` verification).
            *   Implemented performance optimizations (e.g., effect caching for movement checks by relying on `pData` fields updated externally).
            *   Improved robustness (null checks, nullish coalescing for configs).
            *   Ensured `pData.isDirtyForSave = true` was set when appropriate.
    *   **Next Steps for this Objective (Guidance for new AI session):**
        *   The comprehensive review and refactoring pass is complete.
        *   Future work should focus on:
            *   **Targeted Profiling:** If specific performance bottlenecks are reported by users or observed under load, use profiling tools or focused logging to identify and address them in specific modules.
            *   **New Feature Implementation:** Adding new checks or core features will require their own performance considerations during development.
            *   **Advanced Optimizations:** Based on profiling, explore more advanced optimizations if necessary (e.g., further reducing API calls, optimizing very specific algorithms in complex checks).

*   **3. General Project Review (Completed for this session):**
    *   Adherence to `Dev/CodingStyle.md` has been applied across all reviewed `AntiCheatsBP` script files during this session.
    *   Task files (`ongoing.md`, `completed.md`) have been updated to reflect the work done.
