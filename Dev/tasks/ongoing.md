# Ongoing Tasks

This file lists tasks that are currently being worked on. Once a task is completed, it should be moved to `Dev/tasks/completed.md`. If a task is paused or deprioritized, it can be moved back to `Dev/tasks/todo.md`.

## General Code Review, Cleanup, and Documentation Update (Jules - Current Session)

*   **Objective:** Review the entire addon, perform code cleanup (comments, unused code, formatting like empty lines), and update documentation (`README.md`, `Dev/*.md`) to reflect the current state and ensure consistency.
*   **Current Sub-task:** Reviewing and removing excessive empty lines from source files.
*   **Progress:**
    *   Initial code scans completed.
    *   Comment review completed for key files.
    *   Internal unused code review completed for key files.
    *   Excessive empty line removal completed for all script directories.
    *   Read `AGENTS.md` and relevant style guides.
    *   Developer documentation (`README.md` (main), `Dev/CodingStyle.md`, `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`, `Dev/README.md`) reviewed; no major changes needed from this pass.
    *   Refactored `formatDimensionName` from `uiManager.js` to `playerUtils.js` and updated usages.
*   **Current Sub-task:** Finalizing documentation updates related to the `formatDimensionName` refactor.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Submit current refactoring work.
    *   (Potentially) Address larger documentation updates or other tasks based on user feedback.
