# Ongoing Tasks & Next Steps for Development

This document summarizes the current work-in-progress and pending tasks for the AntiCheat addon, intended for handoff to the next development session.

## I. Current Active Plan: Coding Style Review & Corrections - Batch 1 & 2 (Core, Checks Directories)

*   - Coding style review and corrections for core files completed (including `i18n.js` constant rename, `camelCase` for log `actionType`s in `eventHandlers.js` & `uiManager.js`, `logManager.js` JSDoc update, `reportManager.js` logging refactor). Details moved to `completed.md`.
*   - Reviewed all files in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/` subdirectories for style compliance.
*   - Corrected `console.warn` to `playerUtils.debugLog` in `checks/chat/swearCheck.js`.
*   - Removed duplicated code block in `checks/movement/invalidSprintCheck.js`.
*   - Refactored `logManager.addLog` `actionType` to `camelCase` in `checks/player/clientInfoChecks.js`.
*   - Uncommented useful `debugLog` calls in `checks/world/entityChecks.js`, `fastUseCheck.js`, and `illegalItemCheck.js`.
*   - Noted consistent use of `snake_case` for `checkType` identifiers throughout all `checks` files (e.g., 'movement_fly_hover', 'player_antigmc').

## II. General Pending Tasks (from `Dev/tasks/todo.md`)

These are higher-level features and areas for future development:

*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   Packet Anomalies: Investigate and implement detections.
    *   Further Chat Violations (if any specific ones are identified beyond current checks).
*   **SjnExe Parity Goals (Broad Categories):**
    *   Admin Tools & Management Expansion.
    *   UI Enhancements (Admin Panel).
    *   System Features.
    *   World Management & Protection.
    *   Normal Player Panel Features (`!panel`):
*   **Specific Deferred/Considered Features:**
    *   `!worldborder`: Advanced dynamic particle effects (previously deferred).
    *   `!worldborder`: Support for more complex shapes (currently a consideration).
*   **AutoMod System:**
    - **Post-Developer Review & General Refinement:**
        - Review all AutoMod rule thresholds and actions for balance and effectiveness.
        - Implement AutoMod rules for any other minor or uncovered checks if deemed necessary.
        - Consider if `flyCheck.js` and `speedCheck.js` need more granular AutoMod rules for different sub-types of violations beyond what's currently implemented (e.g., if they generate more specific `checkType`s that aren't yet covered).

## III. Project-Wide Conventions / Refactoring

## IV. Recent User Feedback & Context for Future Work

*   **UI Command Design:** For future UI-based commands (e.g., a potential `!admin` command or enhancements to `!panel`), design them to be accessible by various permission levels, showing different information/buttons contextually (similar to the recent `!panel` refactor for player vs. admin views).
*   **Development Workflow:** Continue applying cleanup and refactoring "in batches" where appropriate.
