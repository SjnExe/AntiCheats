## Documentation Review and Update (Jules - Session Start: 2024-08-01)

**Objective:** Thoroughly review the entire addon codebase to understand its current functionality, architecture, and coding conventions. Subsequently, update the main `README.md` and all documentation files within the `Dev/` directory (`Dev/README.md`, `Dev/CodingStyle.md`, `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`) to ensure they are accurate, comprehensive, and reflective of the current state of the addon.

**Key Areas of Focus for Documentation Update:**
*   Verify and update descriptions of core features.
*   Ensure setup and configuration instructions are accurate.
*   Confirm that coding style and standardization guidelines match actual codebase practices, particularly regarding naming conventions (`camelCase` for `checkType`, `actionType`, etc.).
*   Add architectural overview and key data flow explanations to `Dev/README.md` to aid future development.
*   Ensure all internal and external links in documentation are correct.
*   Reflect any changes to the build process or development workflow.

**Status:** In progress.
*   [x] Codebase review complete.
*   [x] `Dev/README.md` updated.
*   [x] `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md` updated.
*   [x] `Dev/CodingStyle.md` reviewed (no changes needed).
*   [x] Root `README.md` updated.
*   [ ] Task management files update (this step).
