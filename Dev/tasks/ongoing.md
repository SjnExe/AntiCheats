# Ongoing Tasks & Next Steps for Development

This document summarizes the current work-in-progress and pending tasks for the AntiCheat addon, intended for handoff to the next development session.

## II. General Pending Tasks (from `Dev/tasks/todo.md`)

These are higher-level features and areas for future development:

*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   Packet Anomalies: Investigate and implement detections.
    *   Further Chat Violations (if any specific ones are identified beyond current checks).
*   **SjnExe Parity Goals (Broad Categories):**
    *   Admin Tools & Management Expansion.
    *   UI Enhancements (Admin Panel).
    *   System Features.
    *   World Management & Protection.
    *   Normal Player Panel Features (`!panel`):
        *   The "Helpful Links" section in the player panel is currently a placeholder and needs implementation.
*   **Specific Deferred/Considered Features:**
    *   `!worldborder`: Advanced dynamic particle effects (previously deferred).
    *   `!worldborder`: Support for more complex shapes (currently a consideration).
*   **AutoMod System:**
    *   Activate the AutoMod system (`enableAutoMod` is currently `false`).
    *   Implement and refine AutoMod rules for existing and new check types.

## III. Recent User Feedback & Context for Future Work

*   **UI Command Design:** For future UI-based commands (e.g., a potential `!admin` command or enhancements to `!panel`), design them to be accessible by various permission levels, showing different information/buttons contextually (similar to the recent `!panel` refactor for player vs. admin views).
*   **Development Workflow:** Continue applying cleanup and refactoring "in batches" where appropriate.
