## ESLint Error Resolution and Code Conformance (Jules - AI)
*   **Objective:** Identify and fix ESLint errors and warnings throughout the JavaScript codebase. Ensure code adheres to established project linting rules and coding standards.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Ran `npm run lint` to identify all issues.
    *   Systematically addressed errors such as `require-atomic-updates`, `no-loop-func`, `guard-for-in`, `default-param-last`, and a parsing error.
    *   Addressed or suppressed `no-unused-vars` warnings.
    *   Iteratively re-ran linter to confirm fixes.
*   **Current Status:** All ESLint errors resolved. Two persistent `no-unused-vars` warnings remain, believed to be false positives. Preparing to submit changes.
