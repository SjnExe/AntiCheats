# Ongoing Tasks
*(Date: Current Session)*

---
*Previous tasks, including "Comprehensive Coding Style Review", "Refactor: Standardize Check Actions & Configurable Punishments", "Admin Panel UI: View Ban/Mute Logs", "Admin Panel UI: Integrate InvSee", "Admin Panel UI: Quick Actions (Player Inspection)", the "Refactor `commandManager.js`" (modular command system), Reporting System (`!report`, `!viewreports`), `!uinfo` UI implementation, `!help` command verification, `!systeminfo` command, `!copyinv` command, `!vanish` logging, `!clearchat` logging, `!invsee` implementation, Lag Clear via Admin Panel, `!warnings`/`!clearwarnings`/`!resetflags` commands, `!freeze` logging, `!kick` verification, and `todo.md` syntax updates, were completed and documented in `completed.md`.*

*   **Optimization and Code Efficiency Review - Phase 3: `playerDataManager.js`**:
    *   **Primary Objective:** Review `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/playerDataManager.js` for runtime performance optimization opportunities. This includes analyzing data structures, access patterns, persistence mechanisms, and function efficiency.
    *   **Secondary Objective:** Identify possibilities for code reduction (Lines of Code) where it does not negatively impact performance or the primary optimization goals.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Analyze data storage (Map usage, dynamic properties) for efficiency.
        *   Review frequency and payload of `savePlayerDataToDynamicProperties`.
        *   Examine functions like `ensurePlayerDataInitialized`, `addFlag`, `getPlayerData` for potential bottlenecks or improvements.
        *   Identify any dead/unused code.
        *   Consolidate redundant logic if it improves performance or maintains it while reducing code.
    *   **Constraints:** Changes must maintain functional equivalence. Performance improvements are prioritized over code reduction if they conflict.
    *   **Process:** Iterative review. Findings and proposed changes will be detailed, followed by implementation and commit.
