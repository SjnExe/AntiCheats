*Previous tasks, including "Comprehensive Coding Style Review", "Refactor: Standardize Check Actions & Configurable Punishments", "Admin Panel UI: View Ban/Mute Logs", "Admin Panel UI: Integrate InvSee", "Admin Panel UI: Quick Actions (Player Inspection)", the "Refactor `commandManager.js`" (modular command system), Reporting System (`!report`, `!viewreports`), `!uinfo` UI implementation, `!help` command verification, `!systeminfo` command, `!copyinv` command, `!vanish` logging, `!clearchat` logging, `!invsee` implementation, Lag Clear via Admin Panel, `!warnings`/`!clearwarnings`/`!resetflags` commands, `!freeze` logging, `!kick` verification, and `todo.md` syntax updates, were completed and documented in `completed.md`.*

*   **Aggressive Code Reduction Review - Phase 1: `playerUtils.js`**:
    *   **Objective:** Review `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/utils/playerUtils.js` to identify and implement opportunities for significant code reduction (Lines of Code).
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Identify and remove dead/unused code (variables, functions).
        *   Consolidate redundant logic into shared helpers if applicable.
        *   Rewrite overly verbose implementations more concisely.
        *   Simplify complex logic or algorithms where possible.
    *   **Constraints:** Changes must maintain functional equivalence and not negatively impact runtime performance. Clarity may be impacted if necessary for LoC reduction, as per user direction.
    *   **Process:** This will be done iteratively. Findings and proposed changes for sections of the file (or the whole file if small enough) will be made, followed by implementation and commit.
