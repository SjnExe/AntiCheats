# Ongoing Tasks & Next Steps for Development

This document summarizes the current work-in-progress and pending tasks for the AntiCheat addon, intended for handoff to the next development session.

## Current Focus: General Code Cleanup (In Progress)
*   Completed cleanup (empty lines, comments, obvious unused code) for Batch 1 (Core Chat Checks).
*   Next: Proceed with Batch 2 (Core Manager files).

### High Priority / Next Up
*No high priority tasks currently identified.*

### Medium Priority

*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   **Packet Anomalies:** (Research Phase complete; 'Force Criticals' deemed not feasible. Full research notes in `Dev/notes/PacketAnomalyResearch.md`. Re-evaluate if other specific anomaly detection strategies are viable.)

*   **Admin Tools & Management (Expansion):** SjnExe parity goal where applicable.
    *   (Further enhancements or specific SjnExe parity features for Admin Tools can be listed here as they are identified).
    *   **Enhanced Commands:**
        *   `!worldborder` Enhancements: (Initial features complete. Further enhancements to consider, see `Dev/notes/WorldBorderDesign.md`):
    *   **UI Enhancements (Admin Panel Concept):** SjnExe parity goal.
        *   *(Existing: Base UI with Inspect, Reset Flags, List Watched, Player Actions, Server Management, Config Editor)*
    *   **System Features:** SjnExe parity goal.

*   **World Management & Protection:** SjnExe parity goal.

*   **Normal Player Panel Features (`!panel`):** SjnExe parity goal.
    *   (Further enhancements or specific SjnExe parity features for `!panel` can be listed here as they are identified).

### Low Priority / Ideas

*   **Player Utilities & Experience:** SjnExe parity goal.

### Documentation & Workflow
*   **Task File Maintenance:** AI assistant should keep `completed.md`, `ongoing.md`, and `todo.md` current.

## Recent User Feedback & Context for Future Work

*   **UI Command Design:** For future UI-based commands (e.g., a potential `!admin` command or enhancements to `!panel`), design them to be accessible by various permission levels, showing different information/buttons contextually (similar to the recent `!panel` refactor for player vs. admin views).
*   **Development Workflow:** Continue applying cleanup and refactoring "in batches" where appropriate.
