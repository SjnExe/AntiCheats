*   **Aggressive Code Reduction Review - Phase 2: `itemUtils.js`**:
    *   **Objective:** Review `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/utils/itemUtils.js` for significant code reduction (Lines of Code).
    *   **Methods:** Dead/unused code removal, consolidation of redundant logic, conciseness improvements, logic/algorithm simplification.
    *   **Constraints:** Maintain functional equivalence; no negative runtime performance impact. Clarity impact is acceptable if LoC reduction is significant.
    *   **Process:** Iterative review, proposal, implementation, and commit.
