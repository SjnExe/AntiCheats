# Ongoing Tasks & Next Steps for Development

This document summarizes the current work-in-progress and pending tasks for the AntiCheat addon, intended for handoff to the next development session.

## I. Current Active Plan: AutoMod Rule Refinement and Implementation

*   Investigated current AutoMod configuration in `automodConfig.js`.
*   Identified available check types from `config.js` and check modules.
*   Determined checks lacking AutoMod rules, noting those needing key verification (e.g., 'example_' prefixes).
*   Implemented initial AutoMod rules for 7 chat-related checks (AntiAdvertising, Caps, CharRepeat, SymbolSpam, Newline, MaxMessageLength, SpamRepeat).
*   Verified/Corrected `checkType` key for `fly_hover` to `movement_hover_fly` in `automodConfig.js`.
*   Analyzed `flyCheck.js`: Identified `movement_high_y_velocity` and `movement_sustained_fly` as additional `checkType`s.
*   Implemented AutoMod rules for `movement_high_y_velocity` and `movement_sustained_fly`.
*   Analyzed `speedCheck.js`: Confirmed `example_speed_ground` is the current `checkType`; no other types implemented in script.
*   Analyzed `reachCheck.js`: Confirmed `example_reach_attack` is the current `checkType`.
*   Modified `eventHandlers.js` to add flagging for `chat_newline` and `chat_maxlength` (dependent on config flags `flagOnNewline`, `flagOnMaxMessageLength`).
*   Investigated `chat_repeat_spam`: Believed `eventHandlers.js` config key was corrected; actual `checkType` from `checks.checkSpam` implementation still needs developer verification.
*   Implemented AutoMod rules (Warn, Teleport, Kick, TempBan) for `NetherRoofCheck` (checkType: `movement_nether_roof`).
*   Implemented `FLAG_ONLY` AutoMod rule for `PistonLagCheck` (checkType: `world_antigrief_piston_lag`).

## II. General Pending Tasks (from `Dev/tasks/todo.md`)

These are higher-level features and areas for future development:

*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   Packet Anomalies: Investigate and implement detections.
    *   Further Chat Violations (if any specific ones are identified beyond current checks).
*   **SjnExe Parity Goals (Broad Categories):**
    *   Admin Tools & Management Expansion.
    *   UI Enhancements (Admin Panel).
    *   System Features.
    *   World Management & Protection.
    *   Normal Player Panel Features (`!panel`):
*   **Specific Deferred/Considered Features:**
    *   `!worldborder`: Advanced dynamic particle effects (previously deferred).
    *   `!worldborder`: Support for more complex shapes (currently a consideration).
*   **AutoMod System:**
    *   Continue AutoMod refinement: Verify/Update `example_speed_ground` & `example_reach_attack` keys (and refactor checks if desired). Clarify/Verify `chat_repeat_spam` `checkType` and `checks.checkSpam` implementation. Review thresholds and actions for all rules. Implement rules for any other minor/uncovered checks if deemed necessary.

## III. Recent User Feedback & Context for Future Work

*   **UI Command Design:** For future UI-based commands (e.g., a potential `!admin` command or enhancements to `!panel`), design them to be accessible by various permission levels, showing different information/buttons contextually (similar to the recent `!panel` refactor for player vs. admin views).
*   **Development Workflow:** Continue applying cleanup and refactoring "in batches" where appropriate.
