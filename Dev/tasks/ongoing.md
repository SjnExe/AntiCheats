# Ongoing Tasks & Next Steps for Development

This document summarizes the current work-in-progress and pending tasks for the AntiCheat addon, intended for handoff to the next development session.

## I. Current Active Plan: "Code Cleanup - Batch 2" (In Progress)

The following files are pending analysis and cleanup as part of this batch:

*   **Core Files:**
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/logManager.js` (Analysis was next)
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/reportManager.js`
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/tpaManager.js`
*   **Checks Barrel File:**
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/index.js`
*   **Specific Check Files:**
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/chat/capsAbuseCheck.js`
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/movement/flyCheck.js`
*   **Commands Barrel File:**
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/commands/commandRegistry.js`
*   **Specific Command Files:**
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/commands/kick.js`
    *   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/commands/version.js`

**Note:** Upon completion of Batch 2, all changes from this batch should be committed.

## II. General Pending Tasks (from `Dev/tasks/todo.md`)

These are higher-level features and areas for future development:

*   **Advanced Cheat Detections:**
    *   Packet Anomalies: Investigate and implement detections.
    *   Further Chat Violations (if any specific ones are identified beyond current checks).
*   **SjnExe Parity Goals (Broad Categories):**
    *   Admin Tools & Management Expansion.
    *   UI Enhancements (Admin Panel).
    *   System Features.
    *   World Management & Protection.
    *   Normal Player Panel Features (`!panel`):
        *   The "Helpful Links" section in the player panel is currently a placeholder and needs implementation.
*   **Specific Deferred/Considered Features:**
    *   `!worldborder`: Advanced dynamic particle effects (previously deferred).
    *   `!worldborder`: Support for more complex shapes (currently a consideration).
*   **AutoMod System:**
    *   Activate the AutoMod system (`enableAutoMod` is currently `false`).
    *   Implement and refine AutoMod rules for existing and new check types.

## III. Recent User Feedback & Context for Future Work

*   **Documentation:** Update `README.md` to accurately reflect that `config.js` is now the single central configuration file (following the merge of `userSettings.js`).
*   **UI Command Design:** For future UI-based commands (e.g., a potential `!admin` command or enhancements to `!panel`), design them to be accessible by various permission levels, showing different information/buttons contextually (similar to the recent `!panel` refactor for player vs. admin views).
*   **Development Workflow:** Continue applying cleanup and refactoring "in batches" where appropriate.
