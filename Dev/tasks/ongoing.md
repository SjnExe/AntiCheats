## Documentation: Create AGENTS.md (Jules - Session Start: 2024-08-01)

**Objective:** Evaluate the need for and potentially create a dedicated `AGENTS.md` file in the root directory to provide high-level instructions and tips for AI agents working on the codebase, as an improvement over or supplement to the AI section in `Dev/README.md`.

**Key Actions:**
*   Reviewed existing AI guidelines in `Dev/README.md`.
*   Evaluated the benefits of a separate `AGENTS.md` for AI discoverability and detailed, project-specific instructions.
*   Decided to create `AGENTS.md` in the root directory.
*   Drafted content for `AGENTS.md`, incorporating and expanding on previous AI notes from `Dev/README.md`. Added emphasis on critical project conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for `checkType`/`actionType`) and architectural awareness.
*   Updated `Dev/README.md` to remove its detailed AI workflow section and instead link to the new `AGENTS.md`.

**Status:**
*   [x] Review of existing AI guidelines complete.
*   [x] Evaluation of need for `AGENTS.md` complete; decision made to create it.
*   [x] `AGENTS.md` created and drafted.
*   [x] `Dev/README.md` updated to reference `AGENTS.md`.
*   [ ] Task management files update (this step).
*   [ ] Final submission.
