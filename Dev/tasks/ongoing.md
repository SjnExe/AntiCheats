## Documentation & Typing Update: types.js Review (Jules - Session Start: 2024-08-01)

**Objective:** Ensure `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/types.js` contains JSDoc typedefs for all complex or recurring object structures used across the addon, particularly for the `dependencies` object and `PlayerAntiCheatData`.

**Key Actions:**
*   Gathered information on data structures by reviewing `types.js`, `main.js`, core manager files (`playerDataManager.js`, `actionManager.js`, `automodManager.js`, `commandManager.js`, `rankManager.js`, `reportManager.js`, `tpaManager.js`, `worldBorderManager.js`), associated config files (`actionProfiles.js`, `automodConfig.js`, `ranksConfig.js`), and sample check/command files.
*   Identified missing, incomplete, or misplaced typedefs.
*   Moved JSDoc typedefs for `ActionProfile*`, `AutoMod*`, and `Rank*` from their original files into `types.js`.
*   Created new typedefs for `WorldBorderSettings`, a generic `ViolationDetails`, and `EventSpecificData`.
*   Performed a detailed review and update of the `PlayerAntiCheatData` typedef, ensuring all fields from `initializeDefaultPlayerData` and other relevant modules are included and correctly typed.
*   Performed a detailed review and update of the `Dependencies` typedef to accurately reflect the object returned by `getStandardDependencies()` in `main.js`, including all module properties and subsets.
*   Ensured JSDoc comments for moved and updated typedefs are clear and descriptive.

**Status:**
*   [x] Information gathering on data structures complete.
*   [x] Identification of missing/incomplete typedefs complete.
*   [x] Drafting new and updating existing typedefs in `types.js` complete.
*   [ ] Task management files update (this step).
*   [ ] Final submission.
