## General Code Review, Cleanup, and Documentation Update (Jules - Current Session)

*   **Objective:** Review the entire addon, perform code cleanup (comments, unused code, formatting like empty lines), and update documentation (`README.md`, `Dev/*.md`) to reflect the current state and ensure consistency.
*   **Current Sub-task:** Reviewing and removing excessive empty lines from source files.
*   **Progress:**
    *   Initial code scans completed.
    *   Comment review completed for key files.
    *   Internal unused code review completed for key files.
    *   Excessive empty line removal completed for all script directories.
    *   Read `AGENTS.md` and relevant style guides.
    *   Developer documentation (`README.md` (main), `Dev/CodingStyle.md`, `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`, `Dev/README.md`) reviewed; no major changes needed from this pass.
    *   Refactored `formatDimensionName` from `uiManager.js` to `playerUtils.js`, updated usages, and relevant JSDoc/task documentation. (Completed)
*   **Current Sub-task:** Reviewing API readiness checks in `main.js`.
*   **Progress on current sub-task:**
    *   Reviewed `checkEventAPIsReady` function and its usage in `attemptInitializeSystem`.
    *   Modified `attemptInitializeSystem` to prevent initialization if critical APIs are missing after max retries.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Finalize any documentation for this change.
    *   Submit changes related to API readiness review.
    *   (Potentially) Address larger documentation updates or other tasks based on user feedback.
