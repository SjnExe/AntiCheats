*   **Player Behavior - Advanced:** SjnExe parity goal.
    *   **Namespoof:** Check `player.nameTag` for excessive length, use of disallowed characters (e.g., non-ASCII, control characters beyond typical gameplay names), or rapid changes. (Scythe, SjnExe)
        *   *Note: Concern raised about potential false positives for console players (e.g., due to spaces, specific character sets, or typical console Gamertag lengths). Ensure implementation is flexible or provides configuration to handle this when developing this feature.*
