### Analysis of JSON Files

**1. File: `AntiCheatsBP/manifest.json`**
*   **JSON Syntax:** Valid.
*   **Data Structures/Formatting:** Consistent 2-space indentation. Uses snake_case for keys. Standard Minecraft manifest structure. Version placeholders `__VERSION_STRING__` and `__VERSION_ARRAY__` are present. `min_engine_version` is `[1, 21, 80]`.
*   **Potential Issues:** None found.
*   **Overall:** Well-formed manifest.

*   **Potential Issues:** None found.
*   **Overall:** Well-formed manifest.

**3. File: `AntiCheatsRP/ui/settings_sections/world_section.json`**
*   **JSON Syntax:** Valid.
*   **Data Structures/Formatting:** Consistent 2-space indentation. Key `game_section/level_seed_selector` uses a slash, which is valid. Simple structure.
*   **Potential Issues:** None found.
