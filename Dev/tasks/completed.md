## Update Project Status in README (Jules - Completed YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective:** Adjust the `README.md` to accurately reflect the project's current experimental status and active development state, warning users about potential instability.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **Status Badge Updated**:
    *   The existing `Status: Active` (green) badge was changed to `Status: Under Development` (orange) for a quick visual cue.
    *   Markdown changed from `<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-green?style=for-the-badge" alt="Status: Active"/>` to `<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Under%20Development-orange?style=for-the-badge" alt="Status: Under Development"/>`.
*   **Added Prominent Status Note**:
    *   A new section titled "⚠️ CURRENT PROJECT STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL - USE WITH CAUTION ⚠️" was inserted as a blockquote immediately after the top badges and before the main project description.
    *   This note explicitly states:
        *   The addon is under active development and experimental.
        *   It may contain significant bugs or errors.
        *   Functionality is subject to change and may be unstable.
        *   It is not recommended for production servers at this stage.
        *   Encourages users to report issues on GitHub.
*   **Updated Task Files**: This task was added to `ongoing.md` and subsequently documented here in `completed.md`.

**Outcome:** The `README.md` now more accurately represents the project's development phase, providing clear warnings to potential users about its experimental nature and potential for bugs, while still encouraging testing and feedback.
