- **(High) Correctness & Stability Batch** - Completed by Jules on 2025-08-08
  - **Summary:** Applied a series of critical fixes to improve the addon's stability, data integrity, and reliability.
  - **Changes:**
    - Fixed a bug in `config.js` that allowed the default configuration to be mutated at runtime.
    - Refactored the data recovery logic in `playerDataManager.js` to prevent catastrophic data loss when the dynamic property size limit is exceeded.
    - Verified that the grace period logic in detection scripts is sound and correct.
    - Enforced consistent `player.isValid()` checks in `uiManager.js`, `reload.js`, `restart.js`, `eventHandlers.js`, and `automodManager.js` to prevent crashes from disconnected players.
  - **Submission:** `refactor/stability-fixes` branch.
