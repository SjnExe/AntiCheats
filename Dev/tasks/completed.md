## Refactor: Reorganized Script File Structure (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Completed a major reorganization of the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/` directory to improve modularity, maintainability, and clarity of the codebase.

*   **Key Structural Changes:**
    *   **`core/` Directory Created:**
        *   `playerDataManager.js`: Centralizes player data management, including the runtime `playerData` map, loading/saving data via dynamic properties, default data initialization, and the new centralized `addFlag` function.
        *   `commandManager.js`: Handles parsing and execution of chat commands (e.g., `!ac version`, `!ac watch`, `!ac ui`).
        *   `uiManager.js`: Manages all admin UI forms (`ActionFormData`, `ModalFormData`, `MessageFormData`) for actions like inspect, reset flags, and list watched players.
        *   `eventHandlers.js`: Contains the callback logic for various world events (`playerLeave`, `entityHurt`, `playerBreakBlock`, `itemUse`, `itemUseOn`).
    *   **`checks/` Directory Created:**
        *   Subdirectories `movement/`, `combat/`, and `world/` were created.
        *   Original monolithic check files (`movementChecks.js`, `combatChecks.js`, `worldChecks.js`) were split into individual files for each specific check (e.g., `flyCheck.js`, `reachCheck.js`, `nukerCheck.js`) and placed in the appropriate subdirectory.
        *   A barrel file `checks/index.js` was created to export all check functions for easy importing.
    *   **`utils/` Directory:**
        *   `playerUtils.js` was moved here (`utils/playerUtils.js`) and updated to only contain general utility functions like `isAdmin`, `warnPlayer`, `notifyAdmins`, `debugLog`. Persistence functions were moved to `playerDataManager.js`.
*   **Refactoring Details:**
    *   **Centralized `addFlag`:** All individual check files were refactored to use the new `addFlag` function in `playerDataManager.js`, removing redundant flagging, notification, and saving logic from each check.
    *   **`main.js` Slimmed Down:** The main script file (`main.js`) now acts as an orchestrator. It initializes modules, subscribes events to handlers in the `core` modules, and runs the main tick loop. Most of its previous direct logic for commands, UI, data management, and event handling has been delegated.
    *   **Import Paths Updated:** All `import` statements across the modified and newly created files were updated to reflect the new file locations and module structure.
*   **Follow-up Considerations:**
    *   Noted that JSDoc typedefs for `PlayerAntiCheatData` and `PlayerFlagData` (currently commented out or assumed in `playerDataManager.js`) should ideally be moved to a separate `types.js` file to resolve potential circular dependencies and improve type management. This is noted as a new task in `todo.md`.

This reorganization significantly enhances the project's structure, making it easier to navigate, maintain, and extend in the future.

## Killaura/Aimbot Detection Investigation (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Conducted an investigation into methods for detecting Killaura and Aimbot cheats using the `@minecraft/server` API. This involved reviewing existing community projects, researching common detection techniques, analyzing API capabilities, and outlining potential detection logic.

*   **Key Activities & Findings:**
    *   Reviewed internal documentation and external projects (Scythe Anticheat, SafeGuard Anticheat) for initial insights.
    *   Researched various detection heuristics, including state conflicts, "no swing" attacks (noted as difficult with current API), multi-target analysis, invalid rotation/view snapping, hit consistency, and targeting anomalies.
    *   Assessed the feasibility of these techniques based on available `@minecraft/server` API features (player view/rotation, entity hurt events, player states, target information).
    *   Outlined potential logic for promising checks:
        *   Invalid Rotation / View Snap (Aimbot component).
        *   Multi-Target / Fast Target Switching (Killaura component).
        *   Attacking During Invalid States (e.g., sleeping).
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The detailed findings, API feasibility analysis, outlined detection logic, and recommendations for initial implementation focus (View Snap, Multi-Target Killaura, State Conflict - Sleeping) are documented in the newly created `Dev/Killaura_Aimbot_Investigation.md` file. This document provides a foundation for future development of these advanced cheat detection modules.

## Updated Root README.md (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

The main project `README.md` was significantly updated to reflect the current state of the Anti-Cheats Addon, including recent feature additions and providing a more comprehensive guide for users and administrators.

*   **Key Sections Added/Revised:**
    *   **Features:** Summarizes core capabilities including cheat detections (Movement, Combat, World), Admin Tools (text commands and new UI), Configuration options, Data Persistence, and the Player Flagging System.
    *   **Required Experimental Toggles:** Clarified the need for "Beta APIs."
    *   **Setup:** Includes a note on the target Minecraft version (1.21.80+).
    *   **Admin Commands & UI:** Detailed list of available commands, distinguishing between the new `!ac ui` and its sub-menus (Inspect Player, Reset Flags, List Watched) and the existing text-based commands.
    *   **Configuration:** Highlights the role of `config.js` for adjustments.
    *   **Player Usage:** Mentions the `!ac myflags` command.
*   The README now serves as a more accurate and user-friendly documentation for the addon.

## Implemented Basic Admin UI (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Implemented a basic Admin User Interface (UI) accessible via the `!ac ui` command. This UI provides administrators with interactive forms for common anti-cheat management tasks.

*   **Access Command:** `!ac ui` (only available to players with the 'admin' tag).
*   **Main Menu (`ActionFormData`):**
    *   Title: "AntiCheat Admin Menu"
    *   Options:
        1.  **Inspect Player Data:**
            *   Uses a `ModalFormData` to prompt for a player's name.
            *   Displays the target player's anti-cheat data (flags, watched status, etc.) in chat, similar to the `!ac inspect` text command.
            *   Includes input validation and error handling for player/data not found.
        2.  **Reset Player Flags:**
            *   Uses a `ModalFormData` to prompt for a player's name and a confirmation toggle.
            *   If confirmed, resets the target player's flags and relevant violation data (e.g., `consecutiveOffGroundTicks`, `attackEvents`).
            *   Persists the changes using `prepareAndSavePlayerData`.
            *   Displays a success/error message to the admin using `MessageFormData`.
            *   Notifies other admins of the action.
        3.  **List Watched Players:**
            *   Uses a `MessageFormData` to display a list of all players currently marked as `isWatched: true`.
            *   Shows a message if no players are currently being watched.
*   **General Implementation Details:**
    *   All UI components are implemented in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/main.js`.
    *   Necessary modules (`ActionFormData`, `ModalFormData`, `MessageFormData`) were imported from `@minecraft/server-ui`.
    *   Includes error handling for form display and processing, with feedback provided to the admin.

## Implemented Player Data Persistence (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Implemented a system for persisting key player anti-cheat data (`pData`) across sessions (server restarts, player rejoin/leave). This ensures that player flags, watched status, and relevant violation tracking information are maintained.

*   **Core Mechanism:**
    *   Utilized Entity Dynamic Properties (`player.setDynamicProperty`, `player.getDynamicProperty`) for storing and retrieving player data.
    *   Data is serialized into a JSON string under the key `anticheat:pdata_v1` on the player entity.
*   **Key Functions Implemented:**
    *   **`savePlayerDataToDynamicProperties(player, pDataToSave)`** (in `playerUtils.js`):
        *   Serializes a defined subset of `pData` (including `flags` object, `isWatched`, `lastFlagType`, `playerNameTag`, `attackEvents`, `lastAttackTime`, `blockBreakEvents`, `consecutiveOffGroundTicks`, `fallDistance`, `consecutiveOnGroundSpeedingTicks`) into JSON.
        *   Saves the JSON string to the player's dynamic property.
        *   Includes error handling and size checks.
    *   **`loadPlayerDataFromDynamicProperties(player)`** (in `playerUtils.js`):
        *   Retrieves the JSON string from the player's dynamic property.
        *   Parses the JSON string and returns the reconstituted data object.
        *   Includes error handling and returns `null` if data is not found or corrupted.
    *   **`prepareAndSavePlayerData(player)`** (helper in `main.js`):
        *   Constructs the specific `persistedPData` object from the runtime `pData` map.
        *   Calls `savePlayerDataToDynamicProperties`.
    *   **`initializeDefaultPlayerData(player)`** (helper in `main.js`):
        *   Creates a fresh, default `PlayerAntiCheatData` object for new players or when persisted data is not found/loaded.
*   **Integration Points:**
    *   **Saving Data:**
        *   Data is saved when a player leaves the game (via `world.beforeEvents.playerLeave`).
        *   Data is saved after modifications via admin commands:
            *   `!ac watch` (when `isWatched` status changes).
            *   `!ac resetflags` (after flags and relevant states are cleared).
    *   **Loading Data:**
        *   When a player joins (or is first processed by the `system.runInterval` in `main.js`), the system attempts to load their persisted data using `loadPlayerDataFromDynamicProperties`.
        *   If data is found, it's merged with a default `pData` structure, prioritizing loaded values.
        *   If no data is found, a fresh default `pData` object is used.
*   **Outcome:** This implementation provides a foundational persistence layer. Further work could involve saving data more frequently (e.g., after every flag increment) if deemed necessary, which would require refactoring the flag-adding logic.

## Player Data Persistence Investigation (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Conducted an investigation into methods for persisting player anti-cheat data (`pData`) to survive server restarts and player rejoins. The research focused on using Scoreboard Objectives and Entity Dynamic Properties available via the `@minecraft/server` API.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Researched the capabilities, pros, and cons of using `world.scoreboard` for numerical data storage.
    *   Researched the capabilities, pros, and cons of using dynamic properties (on `Entity` and `World` objects), particularly with JSON stringification for complex data.
    *   Outlined two potential approaches: one primarily using dynamic properties with JSON, and a hybrid approach.
    *   Provided a recommendation to start with dynamic properties (storing a serialized JSON string of `pData`) due to its flexibility for complex data structures.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   The findings, detailed analysis of each mechanism, potential approaches, and the final recommendation are documented in the newly created `Dev/Persistence_Investigation.md` file. This document will serve as a basis for the future implementation of data persistence.

## Admin Command Implementation (`!ac inspect`, `!ac resetflags`) (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Added two new administrative commands to `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/main.js` to enhance server management capabilities:

*   **`!ac inspect <playername>`:**
    *   Allows admins to view a summary of a target player's anti-cheat data (`pData`).
    *   The summary includes the player's `isWatched` status, total flag count, last flag type, and detailed counts and last detection times for each specific cheat category (e.g., fly, speed, cps).
    *   Handles cases where the player or their data is not found.
*   **`!ac resetflags <playername>`:**
    *   Allows admins to reset a target player's accumulated anti-cheat flags and associated violation-tracking metrics.
    *   Resets `pData.flags.totalFlags` to 0, clears `pData.lastFlagType`.
    *   Resets individual flag counts and `lastDetectionTime` for all categories.
    *   Clears stateful violation trackers such as `consecutiveOffGroundTicks`, `fallDistance`, `consecutiveOnGroundSpeedingTicks`, `attackEvents` (for CPS), and `blockBreakEvents` (for Nuker).
    *   Provides confirmation to the issuing admin and notifies other online admins.

## Manifest API Versioning Update (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Reviewed and initially updated the versions of `@minecraft/server` and related modules in `AntiCheatsBP/manifest.json` to align with the project's `min_engine_version` of `[1, 21, 0]` and utilize recent beta releases for the `1.21.90` engine preview.

*   **Initial Key Version Changes (to `1.21.90-preview.28` series):**
    *   `@minecraft/server`: Updated from `2.0.0-beta` to `2.1.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.
    *   `@minecraft/server-ui`: Updated from `2.0.0-beta` to `2.1.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.
    *   `@minecraft/server-gametest`: Updated from `1.0.0-beta` to `1.0.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.

*   **Update (Reversion due to User Feedback):**
    *   Based on user feedback, the module versions were reverted to their previous state to maintain compatibility or address other concerns.
    *   **Current Versions:**
        *   `@minecraft/server`: `2.0.0-beta`
        *   `@minecraft/server-ui`: `2.0.0-beta`
        *   `@minecraft/server-gametest`: `1.0.0-beta`

## Configuration Review & Expansion (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved a comprehensive review and expansion of the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` file to improve the configurability and maintainability of the cheat detection system.

*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Moved Hardcoded Thresholds:** Identified numerical thresholds previously hardcoded within check functions (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`) and moved them to `config.js` as named constants. This centralizes configuration and makes tuning easier. Affected thresholds included those for reach buffer, CPS calculation window, various fly detection parameters (sustained speed/ticks, hover speed/ticks/height/fall distance), and speed check tolerances/durations.
    *   **Added Enable/Disable Flags:** Introduced boolean flags in `config.js` for each major cheat detection category (Reach, CPS, Fly, Speed, NoFall, Nuker, Illegal Items). Check functions in their respective files (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`, `worldChecks.js`) were updated to respect these flags, allowing administrators to easily toggle entire checks on or off.

## Refine `debugLog` Calls (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved reviewing all `debugLog` calls across the primary check functions (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`, `worldChecks.js`, `main.js`, `playerUtils.js`) to ensure they adhered to the `debugLog(message, contextPlayerNameIfWatched)` signature.

*   **Outcome:**
    *   The review confirmed that the existing `debugLog` calls were already correctly implemented. Player-specific logs appropriately used the second argument for `contextPlayerNameIfWatched` (often based on `pData.isWatched` status), and general logs used a single argument.
    *   No code modifications were necessary as the implementation already met the requirements for detailed contextual logging for watched players.

## Folder Renaming and Path Updates (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved renaming the core Behavior Pack (`BP/`) and Resource Pack (`RP/`) folders to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `AntiCheatsRP/` respectively. All references to these paths within the project's configuration and documentation files were updated accordingly.

*   **Task:** Rename `BP/` and `RP/` folders to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `AntiCheatsRP/` respectively, and update all references.
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Details:**
        *   Renamed the physical folders `BP/` to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `RP/` to `AntiCheatsRP/`.
        *   Updated paths in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
        *   Updated paths in `Dev/README.md`.
        *   Updated paths in the root `README.md`.
        *   Checked and updated paths in `.gitignore`.
