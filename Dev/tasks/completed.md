- **Add loading_messages.json:** Added `OldAntiCheatsRP/ui/loading_messages.json` to the new addon. (Completed by Jules)
- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)
- **Implement Panel and Player Management Enhancements:** Completed a comprehensive set of features including adding a back button, player name suffixes (You, Owner, Admin), and sorting to the player management UI. Implemented new commands (`ecwipe`, `clear`) and verified `invsee`. Enhanced the panel item with glint, lore, and common rarity. Added audio feedback to UI and commands. Ported missing panel features from the old addon. (Completed by Jules)
