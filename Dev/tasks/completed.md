- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)

- **(High) Bug Fix: Stabilize addon for non-beta environments**
  - **Agent:** Jules
  - **Objectives:**
    - Implemented a robust tick loop based on best practices from other anticheat addons.
    - Replaced `world.getAllPlayers()` with `world.getPlayers()` to prevent errors with invalid objects.
    - Added defensive checks to ensure only valid `Player` objects are processed.
    - Temporarily disabled failing event subscriptions to reduce log spam and isolate the core issue.
  - **Branch:** `fix/stable-tick-loop` (self-assigned)
