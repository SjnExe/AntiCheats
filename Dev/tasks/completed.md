- **Add loading_messages.json:** Added `OldAntiCheatsRP/ui/loading_messages.json` to the new addon. (Completed by Jules)
- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)
