## Admin Command Implementation (`!ac inspect`, `!ac resetflags`) (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Added two new administrative commands to `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/main.js` to enhance server management capabilities:

*   **`!ac inspect <playername>`:**
    *   Allows admins to view a summary of a target player's anti-cheat data (`pData`).
    *   The summary includes the player's `isWatched` status, total flag count, last flag type, and detailed counts and last detection times for each specific cheat category (e.g., fly, speed, cps).
    *   Handles cases where the player or their data is not found.
*   **`!ac resetflags <playername>`:**
    *   Allows admins to reset a target player's accumulated anti-cheat flags and associated violation-tracking metrics.
    *   Resets `pData.flags.totalFlags` to 0, clears `pData.lastFlagType`.
    *   Resets individual flag counts and `lastDetectionTime` for all categories.
    *   Clears stateful violation trackers such as `consecutiveOffGroundTicks`, `fallDistance`, `consecutiveOnGroundSpeedingTicks`, `attackEvents` (for CPS), and `blockBreakEvents` (for Nuker).
    *   Provides confirmation to the issuing admin and notifies other online admins.

## Manifest API Versioning Update (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

Reviewed and initially updated the versions of `@minecraft/server` and related modules in `AntiCheatsBP/manifest.json` to align with the project's `min_engine_version` of `[1, 21, 0]` and utilize recent beta releases for the `1.21.90` engine preview.

*   **Initial Key Version Changes (to `1.21.90-preview.28` series):**
    *   `@minecraft/server`: Updated from `2.0.0-beta` to `2.1.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.
    *   `@minecraft/server-ui`: Updated from `2.0.0-beta` to `2.1.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.
    *   `@minecraft/server-gametest`: Updated from `1.0.0-beta` to `1.0.0-beta.1.21.90-preview.28`.

*   **Update (Reversion due to User Feedback):**
    *   Based on user feedback, the module versions were reverted to their previous state to maintain compatibility or address other concerns.
    *   **Current Versions:**
        *   `@minecraft/server`: `2.0.0-beta`
        *   `@minecraft/server-ui`: `2.0.0-beta`
        *   `@minecraft/server-gametest`: `1.0.0-beta`

## Configuration Review & Expansion (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved a comprehensive review and expansion of the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` file to improve the configurability and maintainability of the cheat detection system.

*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Moved Hardcoded Thresholds:** Identified numerical thresholds previously hardcoded within check functions (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`) and moved them to `config.js` as named constants. This centralizes configuration and makes tuning easier. Affected thresholds included those for reach buffer, CPS calculation window, various fly detection parameters (sustained speed/ticks, hover speed/ticks/height/fall distance), and speed check tolerances/durations.
    *   **Added Enable/Disable Flags:** Introduced boolean flags in `config.js` for each major cheat detection category (Reach, CPS, Fly, Speed, NoFall, Nuker, Illegal Items). Check functions in their respective files (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`, `worldChecks.js`) were updated to respect these flags, allowing administrators to easily toggle entire checks on or off.

## Refine `debugLog` Calls (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved reviewing all `debugLog` calls across the primary check functions (`combatChecks.js`, `movementChecks.js`, `worldChecks.js`, `main.js`, `playerUtils.js`) to ensure they adhered to the `debugLog(message, contextPlayerNameIfWatched)` signature.

*   **Outcome:**
    *   The review confirmed that the existing `debugLog` calls were already correctly implemented. Player-specific logs appropriately used the second argument for `contextPlayerNameIfWatched` (often based on `pData.isWatched` status), and general logs used a single argument.
    *   No code modifications were necessary as the implementation already met the requirements for detailed contextual logging for watched players.

## Folder Renaming and Path Updates (Submitted: 2024-07-25)
*(Date is a placeholder based on current interaction)*

This task involved renaming the core Behavior Pack (`BP/`) and Resource Pack (`RP/`) folders to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `AntiCheatsRP/` respectively. All references to these paths within the project's configuration and documentation files were updated accordingly.

*   **Task:** Rename `BP/` and `RP/` folders to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `AntiCheatsRP/` respectively, and update all references.
    *   **Status:** Completed
    *   **Details:**
        *   Renamed the physical folders `BP/` to `AntiCheatsBP/` and `RP/` to `AntiCheatsRP/`.
        *   Updated paths in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
        *   Updated paths in `Dev/README.md`.
        *   Updated paths in the root `README.md`.
        *   Checked and updated paths in `.gitignore`.
