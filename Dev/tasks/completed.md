## Full Addon Checkup and Lint Fixes (Jules)

- **Date Completed:** 2025-08-29
- **Summary:** Performed a full checkup of the addon using ESLint. Identified and fixed 8 linting errors across 8 files.
- **Details:**
  - Fixed 7 `no-dupe-keys` errors in command definition files by merging duplicate `aliases` properties.
  - Fixed 1 `quotes` error by running `eslint --fix`.
  - Verified all fixes by ensuring a clean lint report.
- **Outcome:** The codebase now passes all linting checks, improving code quality and preventing potential runtime errors from the duplicate keys.
