- **Jules (AI Assistant):** Add !reload command. (Completed on 2024-05-24)
  - **Summary:** Added a `!reload` command to allow admins to reload the server configuration without a full restart.

- **Jules (AI Assistant):** Fixing various issues throughout the addon. (Completed on 2024-05-24)
  - **Summary:** This task involved a comprehensive review and fix of several issues within the AntiCheats addon.
  - **Work Done:**
    - Implemented a dynamic and complete cheat check execution loop in `main.js`, replacing the previous static and incomplete implementation. This ensures all available checks are run.
