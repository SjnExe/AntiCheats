**Task:** Improve and Apply ESLint Configuration
**Agent:** Jules
**Date Completed:** 2024-07-11
**Summary:**
- Reviewed `eslint.config.js` against `Dev/CodingStyle.md` and `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`.
- Updated `eslint.config.js` to change the `jsdoc/require-param-description` rule from `off` to `warn` for better alignment with guidelines.
- Added `/** @returns {void} */` to several functions in `playerUtils.js` to satisfy `jsdoc/require-returns` ESLint rule.
- Attempted to fix a persistent parsing error in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/uiManager.js` by simplifying the relevant code block. The error remained, suspected to be a tooling/caching issue as it pointed to a line number of code that was already modified/removed.
- Attempted to fix JSDoc warnings in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/eventHandlers.js` for `handleBeforeChatSend`. Descriptions were present, but warnings persisted, likely due to linter interaction with higher-order functions.
- The codebase is now linted according to the refined configuration, with the exception of the aforementioned persistent issues.
