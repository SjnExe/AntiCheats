- **(High) Implement `!ecwipe` command (Completed by Jules)**
  - **Description:** Added a command to allow administrators to clear a player's Ender Chest.
  - **Details:** After initial experimental versions failed due to incorrect API assumptions, a final, robust version was implemented using the `player.runCommand()` method to loop through and clear each Ender Chest slot individually. The command and all documentation were updated to reflect this single, working implementation.
  - **Submission:** Branch `feature/ecwipe-commands`

- **(High) Fix and Test Player Kicking by Jules**
  - **Objective:** Implement and test a reliable method for kicking non-admin/owner players.
  - **Details:**
    - Create `test.mcfunction` to experiment with various kicking methods.
    - Fix the `!restart` command's player kicking functionality in `restartManager.js`.
    - Ensure the solution correctly identifies admins and owners based on the existing rank system.
