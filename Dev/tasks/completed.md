- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)

- **(High) Bug Fix: Investigate and resolve root cause of tick loop errors**
  - **Agent:** Jules
  - **Objectives:**
    - Investigated other anticheat addons and discovered the use of `world.getPlayers()` instead of `world.getAllPlayers()`.
    - Corrected the "invalid player-like object" and `not a function` errors in the main tick loop by replacing `world.getAllPlayers()` with `world.getPlayers()` and by correctly handling the `currentTick`.
    - Ensured addon stability on worlds that do not support the `beta` capability.
  - **Branch:** `fix/tick-loop-investigation` (self-assigned)
