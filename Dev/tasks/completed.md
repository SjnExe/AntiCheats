- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)

- **(High) Bug Fix: Resolve initialization errors and invalid player object processing**
  - **Agent:** Jules
  - **Objectives:**
    - Fixed script errors caused by missing "beta" capability in `manifest.json`.
    - Corrected the "invalid player-like object" error occurring in the main tick loop by correctly passing the `TickEvent` to the `mainTick` function.
    - Ensured the addon initializes and runs without critical errors.
  - **Branch:** `fix/initialization-errors` (self-assigned)
