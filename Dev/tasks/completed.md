- **Jules (AI Assistant):** Fixing various issues throughout the addon. (Completed on 2024-05-24)
  - **Summary:** This task involved a comprehensive review and fix of several issues within the AntiCheats addon.
  - **Work Done:**
    - Implemented a dynamic and complete cheat check execution loop in `main.js`, replacing the previous static and incomplete implementation. This ensures all available checks are run.
    - Enhanced error logging within the main tick loop to provide more detailed context (e.g., which check failed for which player) to aid in debugging.
    - Fixed a logical bug in the `formatSessionDuration` utility function in `playerUtils.js` to ensure it correctly calculates and displays time durations.
    - Updated all relevant task management and documentation files to reflect the changes.
  - **Submission:** Changes were submitted on branch `fix/multiple-issues`.
