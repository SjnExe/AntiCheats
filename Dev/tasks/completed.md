## Refine README Badges and Clean Up Todo List (Jules - Completed YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective:** Improve README layout by relocating a badge and streamline `Dev/tasks/todo.md` by removing tasks that cannot be completed by the AI due to external dependencies.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **README.md Badge Relocation**:
    *   Reviewed the badge cluster at the top of `README.md`.
    *   Moved the MIT License badge from the top group to the footer paragraph to slightly reduce visual clutter at the top.
*   **`Dev/tasks/todo.md` Cleanup**:
    *   Reviewed remaining "README Enhancements (Further Considerations)".
    *   Removed the following tasks as they require external assets or CI/bot integrations beyond AI capabilities:
        *   `Consider adding a project logo/banner (requires asset).`
        *   `Code size/LoC badge (requires CI integration for dynamic updates or manual static updates).`
    *   Items already marked "(Addressed)" for Discord badge and contributor section were confirmed.
*   **Updated Task Files**: This task was added to `ongoing.md` and subsequently documented here in `completed.md`.

**Outcome:** The `README.md` has a slightly less cluttered header. The `Dev/tasks/todo.md` file is now more focused on actionable items or clear examples for future human development, with non-actionable (for AI) cosmetic tasks removed.
