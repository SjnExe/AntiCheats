## Code Refinement: config.js DRY Initialization (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Refactor `editableConfigValues` in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` to be more DRY by initializing it from a central default object rather than re-listing constants.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Analyzed current `config.js` structure, focusing on `editableConfigValues` and `updateConfigValue`.
*   Implemented a DRY approach by:
    *   Creating a `defaultConfigSettings` object to hold all default values and JSDoc for runtime-editable settings.
    *   Initializing `editableConfigValues` by spreading `defaultConfigSettings`.
    *   Removing redundant individual `export const` declarations for settings now in `defaultConfigSettings`.
*   Confirmed compatibility with `updateConfigValue` and improved maintainability.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/config-dry-editable-values`.

**Summary of Work:**
*   Scanned codebase for "TODO" and "FIXME" comments.
*   Reviewed identified comments:
    *   A feature enhancement TODO in `purgeflags.js` (offline purging) was converted to a new task in `Dev/tasks/todo.md`.
    *   Asset placeholder TODOs in `README.md` were converted to new tasks in `Dev/tasks/todo.md` for tracking.
    *   No quick code fixes or obsolete comment removals were necessary based on the scan.
*   Updated `Dev/tasks/todo.md` with these new items.
*   Updated `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md` to reflect the progress of this review task.
*   **Submission:** Branch `chore/review-todo-fixme-comments`.

## Code Refinement: Optional Chaining Application (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Systematically review and apply optional chaining (`?.`) more broadly across the codebase, especially in `uiManager.js` and `eventHandlers.js`, to improve robustness against errors from potentially null/undefined objects or properties.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Reviewed key files including `uiManager.js`, `eventHandlers.js`, and other core managers/utils.
*   Applied optional chaining (`?.`) to property accesses and method calls on objects that could be `null` or `undefined`, such as Minecraft API objects (Player, Entity, Components), event data properties, and custom data structures (`pData`, `config` sub-objects).
*   Focused on preventing `TypeError` exceptions without altering core logic flow.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/apply-optional-chaining`.

## Documentation: Creation of AGENTS.md (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Evaluate the need for and create a dedicated `AGENTS.md` file to provide high-level instructions for AI agents, enhancing the existing AI guidelines in `Dev/README.md`.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Reviewed existing AI guidelines in `Dev/README.md`.
*   Determined that a separate `AGENTS.md` in the root directory would improve AI discoverability and allow for more detailed, project-specific instructions.
*   Created `AGENTS.md` in the root directory.
*   Drafted its content by incorporating and significantly expanding upon the AI workflow notes previously in `Dev/README.md`. Added emphasis on critical project conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for `checkType`/`actionType`), architectural awareness, and best practices for AI interaction with this codebase.
*   Updated `Dev/README.md` to remove its detailed AI workflow section and instead direct AI agents to the new `AGENTS.md`.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `docs/create-agents-md`.

## Code Refinement: Dynamic `allKnownFlagTypes` (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Refactor `playerDataManager.js` to dynamically generate the `allKnownFlagTypes` array from `actionProfiles.js` instead of using a manually maintained list. This improves consistency and reduces maintenance when adding or modifying cheat checks.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Analyzed `playerDataManager.js` and `actionProfiles.js` to understand the existing manual definition of `allKnownFlagTypes` and its relationship with action profiles.
*   Designed logic to iterate over `checkActionProfiles` from `actionProfiles.js`. For each profile, if a `flag` configuration exists, use `profile.flag.type` if specified, otherwise use the main `checkKey` (the profile's key) as the flag type. A `Set` was used to ensure uniqueness.
*   Implemented this dynamic generation logic at the module scope in `playerDataManager.js`, so `allKnownFlagTypes` is populated when the module loads.
*   The `initializeDefaultPlayerData` function was updated to use this dynamically generated array.
*   Removed the old manually defined `allKnownFlagTypes` array.
*   Conducted a conceptual test to verify the logic against various scenarios.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/dynamic-allknownflagtypes`.

## Code Refinement: Standardize Error Logging (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Review and refactor error logging (`logManager.addLog` with `actionType: 'error...'`) to ensure consistent and useful `context` and `details` are provided for different error types across modules.
**Summary of Work:**
*   **Analysis:** Identified all existing `logManager.addLog` calls for errors and relevant `try...catch` blocks.
*   **Guidelines Defined:** Standardized `actionType` (to `error<ModuleName><SpecificErrorDescription>`), `context` (to `'<moduleName>.<functionName>[.<subContext>]'`), and `details` (to be a structured object including `errorMessage`, `stack`, and other context).
*   **Typedef Update:** Modified `LogEntry` in `types.js` for `details` to be `object | string`.
*   **Refactoring:** Updated error log calls in commands, `main.js`, `playerDataManager.js`, `eventHandlers.js`, `uiManager.js`. Added new error logs where appropriate.
*   **Testing:** Conceptual test confirmed improved clarity and usefulness.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/standardize-error-logging`.

## Code Refinement: Standardize Admin Notifications (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Review all `playerUtils.notifyAdmins` calls to ensure messages are informative and consistently formatted. Introduce configurability for some notifications.
**Summary of Work:**
*   **Analysis:** Identified all `playerUtils.notifyAdmins` call sites and analyzed message content, formatting, and existing prefixes.
*   **Guidelines Defined:** Centralized global prefix in `playerUtils.notifyAdmins` to `§c[AC] §r`. Standardized `baseMessage` content and color coding.
*   **Configuration:** Proposed `config.notifications.<eventName>` keys for toggling specific notification types.
*   **Refactoring:** Modified `playerUtils.notifyAdmins`. Updated `actionProfiles.js` templates. Refactored call sites in commands and core modules to remove local prefixes, standardize messages, and add conditional checks against new config keys.
*   **Testing:** Conceptual test confirmed improved consistency and configurability.
*   **Documentation:** Identified future tasks for documenting new config keys.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/standardize-admin-notifications`.

## Feature: Configurable Sound Events (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Implement a system for playing configurable sound effects for various in-game notifications and actions.
**Summary of Work:**
*   **Configuration:** Defined a `soundEvents` object structure in `config.js` (within `defaultConfigSettings`) allowing users to enable/disable sounds, set Minecraft sound IDs, volume, pitch, and target audience (player, admin, targetPlayer, global) for predefined event names (e.g., `tpaRequestReceived`, `adminNotificationReceived`, `playerWarningReceived`, `automodActionTaken`, `commandSuccess`, `commandError`, `uiFormOpen`).
*   **Utility Function:** Created `playerUtils.playSoundForEvent(player, eventName, dependencies, ?targetPlayerContext)` to look up and play sounds based on the configuration.
*   **Integration:**
    *   Called `playSoundForEvent` from `playerUtils.notifyAdmins` for the `adminNotificationReceived` event.
    *   Updated `playerUtils.warnPlayer` to accept `dependencies` and call `playSoundForEvent` for the `playerWarningReceived` event. Calls to `warnPlayer` in `playerDataManager.js` and `automodManager.js` were updated to pass dependencies.
    *   Added calls in TPA command files (`tpa.js`, `tpahere.js`) for `tpaRequestReceived` sound targeting the recipient.
    *   Added calls in `automodManager.js` for `automodActionTaken` sound targeting the actioned player.
    *   Added representative examples for `commandSuccess` and `commandError` sounds in `kick.js` and `ban.js`.
    *   Added a representative example for `uiFormOpen` sound in `uiManager.js`.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Created `config.example.js` with the new `soundEvents` structure and other key settings.
    *   Updated `Docs/ConfigurationGuide.md` with a detailed section on "Sound Event Configuration."
*   **Testing:** Performed conceptual testing of the system's logic and configurability.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `feat/configurable-sound-events`.

## Chore: Remove config.example.js and Fix JSDoc (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Remove the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.example.js` file and correct an incomplete JSDoc comment in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Deleted the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.example.js` file as per user request, to rely solely on `defaultConfigSettings` within the main `config.js` for default values reference.
*   Corrected the JSDoc block for the `updateConfigValue` function in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` by adding the missing `@param` and `@returns` tags and ensuring the block was properly closed.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `chore/remove-config-example-fix-jsdoc`. (To be submitted next)
