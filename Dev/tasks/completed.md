## Add Dynamic Discord Member Count Badge to README (Jules - Completed YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective:** Replace the static Discord badge in `README.md` with a dynamic one showing the current server member count.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **Researched Options**: Investigated methods for dynamic Discord member count badges, confirming `shields.io` provides a direct solution (`https://img.shields.io/discord/SERVER_ID.svg`) contingent on the Server ID and an enabled server widget.
*   **Obtained Server ID**: User provided the necessary Discord Server ID (`633296555650318346`).
*   **Updated `README.md`**:
    *   Replaced the existing static Discord badge:
        `<a href="https://discord.gg/SMUHUnGyyz"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join_Us-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white" alt="Discord"/></a>`
    *   With the new dynamic badge:
        `<a href="https://discord.gg/SMUHUnGyyz"><img src="https://img.shields.io/discord/633296555650318346?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&color=7289DA" alt="Discord Server"/></a>`
*   **Maintained Link and Style**: Ensured the badge links to the correct Discord invite and retains consistent styling with other badges.

**Outcome:** The `README.md` now features a dynamic Discord badge that displays the live member count, providing a more engaging and informative link to the community.

*(Note: Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the actual completion date)*

**Objective:** Enhance `Docs/AutoModDetails.md` by adding a section with complex rule examples to showcase advanced configuration possibilities of the AutoMod system.

*   **Developed Example Scenarios**: Identified key areas where advanced examples would be beneficial.
*   **Drafted and Integrated Examples**: Added "Advanced Rule Examples" section with three detailed examples (Multi-stage progressive punishment, sensitive check handling, item-specific violation).
