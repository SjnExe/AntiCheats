## Documentation Overhaul - Phase 1 (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Thoroughly review the entire addon codebase to understand its current functionality, architecture, and coding conventions. Subsequently, update the main `README.md` and all documentation files within the `Dev/` directory (`Dev/README.md`, `Dev/CodingStyle.md`, `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`) to ensure they are accurate, comprehensive, and reflective of the current state of the addon.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Conducted a comprehensive review of the AntiCheats addon codebase, including core systems, individual checks, command structures, and configuration files.
*   Updated `Dev/README.md` to include a detailed "Codebase Architecture Overview," explanations of "Key Data Structures and Flows," and notes on "Text and Localization" using `textDatabase.js`.
*   Revised `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md` to explicitly emphasize the mandatory `camelCase` convention for `checkType` and `actionType` string identifiers critical for system functionality, and reinforced the consistent use of optional chaining (`?.`).
*   Reviewed `Dev/CodingStyle.md` and confirmed its alignment with current practices and `StandardizationGuidelines.md` (no changes were needed for this file specifically).
*   Updated the root `README.md` by expanding the "Core Features at a Glance" section to better reflect the addon's diverse capabilities and internal structure, ensuring it's more informative for users.
*   Maintained task management files (`Dev/tasks/ongoing.md`, `Dev/tasks/todo.md`) throughout the process.
*   **Submission:** Branch `docs/update-developer-guides-and-readme`.

## Documentation Update: Docs/FeaturesOverview.md (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Update `Docs/FeaturesOverview.md` to be fully comprehensive and accurate, reflecting all current features, configuration toggles from `config.js`, and major systems like World Border, TPA, and Reporting.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Reviewed the existing `Docs/FeaturesOverview.md` and `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.
*   Identified and outlined discrepancies and missing information.
*   Drafted and revised `Docs/FeaturesOverview.md` with a new structure, covering specific cheat detection categories, key administrative tools, server utility features, and references to relevant `config.js` toggles.
*   Ensured comprehensive descriptions for major systems like World Border, TPA, and the Reporting System.
*   Maintained task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `docs/update-features-overview`.

## Documentation Update: Docs/Commands.md & Alias Enhancement (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:**
1. Verify and update `Docs/Commands.md` to ensure all commands from `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/commands/` are listed with correct syntax, permissions, descriptions, and all effective aliases.
2. Review command aliases in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`, add new beneficial and non-conflicting aliases.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Gathered definitions for all commands in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/commands/`.
*   Analyzed existing command aliases and identified areas for improvement.
*   Updated `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` by adding numerous short and intuitive aliases for commands.
*   Completely revised `Docs/Commands.md` with a new structure (grouped by permission level), ensuring all commands are listed with their primary names, all effective aliases, full syntax, permission levels, and clear descriptions.
*   Maintained task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `docs/update-commands-md-aliases`. (Actual branch name will be from the submit tool call for this task)
*   **Follow-up Correction (Same Session):** Corrected Member permission level in `Docs/Commands.md` from `3+` to `1024 (Default)`.

## Typing System Update: types.js Review & Enhancement (Jules - Completed: 2024-08-01)
**Objective:** Ensure `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/types.js` contains comprehensive and accurate JSDoc typedefs for all complex or recurring object structures, particularly the `dependencies` object and `PlayerAntiCheatData`.
**Summary of Work:**
*   Reviewed `types.js` and numerous core/command/config files to identify data structures.
*   Moved JSDoc typedefs for `ActionProfile*`, `AutoMod*`, and `Rank*` from their original files into `types.js` for centralization.
*   Created new typedefs for `WorldBorderSettings`, a generic `ViolationDetails`, and `EventSpecificData`.
*   Conducted a detailed review and update of the `PlayerAntiCheatData` typedef to ensure all fields used in `playerDataManager.js` and various checks are accurately represented.
*   Performed a thorough review and update of the `Dependencies` typedef to match the object structure provided by `getStandardDependencies()` in `main.js`, including all modules and their subsets.
*   Updated task management files.
*   **Submission:** Branch `refactor/types-js-enhancements`. (Actual branch name will be from the submit tool call for this task)
