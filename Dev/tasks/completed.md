## Comprehensive Codebase Review, Standardization, and Cleanup (Self-Review by Jules)
*   **Date Completed:** (Placeholder for current date - to be filled by system/user)
*   **Objective:** Perform a full review of the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/` codebase to identify and remove unused code, ensure adherence to coding style/standardization, identify/address missing elements, and refactor for clarity/consistency.
*   **Summary of Actions:**
    *   **Phase 1: Core Systems (`core/`, `main.js`, `config.js`, `types.js`):**
        *   Reviewed all files.
        *   Corrected JSDoc in `types.js` for `RankDefinition.permissionLevel` and `RankDefinition.conditions`.
        *   Expanded `persistedPlayerDataKeys` in `playerDataManager.js` for better data persistence and explicitly added `id` to `initializeDefaultPlayerData`'s return object.
        *   Standardized calls and declarations in `uiManager.js` and logging `actionType`s in `eventHandlers.js`.
        *   Core systems were found to be largely robust and well-standardized.
    *   **Phase 2: Checks (`checks/`):**
        *   Reviewed all check files and `checks/index.js`.
        *   Standardized several `actionProfileKey` names in check files (e.g., `noFallCheck.js`, `noSlowCheck.js`, `buildingChecks.js`, `instaBreakCheck.js`, `pistonChecks.js`) to ensure exact case-sensitive matches with `actionProfiles.js`.
        *   Confirmed `checks/index.js` correctly exports all necessary functions.
    *   **Phase 3: Commands (`commands/`):**
        *   Reviewed all command files and `commandRegistry.js`.
        *   Standardized logging in `removerank.js` by removing explicit timestamps.
        *   Corrected `permissionLevel` for `uinfo.js` command to `normal`.
        *   Added missing import for `permissionLevels` in `uinfo.js`.
    *   **Phase 4: Utilities (`utils/`):**
        *   Reviewed all utility files (`itemUtils.js`, `playerUtils.js`, `worldBorderManager.js`, `worldStateUtils.js`, and `utils/index.js`).
        *   Confirmed utilities are actively used and generally well-structured. No changes were made.
    *   **Phase 5: Global Unused Code & Missing Elements:**
        *   Identified commands listed in `config.js` (`commandSettings`) but not implemented: `purgeflags`, `report`, `viewreports`, `clearreports`, `watch`, `unwatch`.
        *   Created basic stub files for these missing commands.
        *   Registered these new stub commands in `commands/commandRegistry.js`.
        *   Confirmed no other major globally unused code blocks or files beyond what was already commented out in the source.
*   **Outcome:** The codebase review is complete. Several minor standardizations and corrections were applied. Stubs for missing commands were created, making the command structure more complete with respect to its configuration. The overall codebase within `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/` is now more consistent. No significant refactoring of complex logic was undertaken as part of this review, which focused on standardization, removal of unused elements, and creation of missing stubs.tool_code
