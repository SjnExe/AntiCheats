## Task: Linting and Syntax Error Fixes (uiManager.js)
- **Agent:** Jules
- **Date Completed:** (Current Date - approximate)
- **Summary of Work:**
    - Attempted to resolve a persistent ESLint parsing error in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/uiManager.js` related to a complex conditional: "Logical expressions and coalesce expressions cannot be mixed."
    - Multiple refactoring strategies were employed, including detailed parenthesization and breaking the condition into intermediate boolean variables.
    - The ESLint environment in development consistently reported the error at its original location (line 756, col 90 of the original file state) even when the code at that location was significantly changed or simplified.
    - Introduced a deliberate syntax error elsewhere in the file, which ESLint correctly detected, confirming that the linter was processing an updated version of the file for some changes but not consistently for the original error location.
    - The final submitted code for `uiManager.js` uses the refactor with intermediate boolean variables, which is believed to be syntactically correct and should avoid the parsing issue if the linter processes the current file state accurately.
- **Submission Reference:**
    - Branch: `fix/linting-uimanager-parser-error`
    - Commit Message Theme: "Fix: Refactor complex conditional in uiManager.js"
