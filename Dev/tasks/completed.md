## Expand `Docs/AutoModDetails.md` with Complex Examples (Jules - Completed YYYY-MM-DD)

**Objective:** Enhance `Docs/AutoModDetails.md` by adding a section with complex rule examples to showcase advanced configuration possibilities of the AutoMod system.

**Summary of Changes:**
*   **Reviewed System Capabilities**: Analyzed `automodConfig.js` and existing `AutoModDetails.md` to understand the features and limitations of the AutoMod rule engine.
*   **Developed Example Scenarios**: Identified key areas where advanced examples would be beneficial, including:
    *   Multi-stage progressive punishments with strategic flag resets.
    *   Cautious rule-setting for sensitive or potentially noisy checks.
    *   Use of specific action types like `removeIllegalItem` and `freeze`.
*   **Drafted and Integrated Examples**:
    *   Added a new section titled "Advanced Rule Examples" to `Docs/AutoModDetails.md`.
    *   Provided three detailed examples with JSON-like rule structures and explanations:
        1.  **Multi-Stage Progressive Punishment for `movementFlyHover`**: Showcasing multiple warnings, escalating temp-bans, and strategic use of `resetFlagsAfterAction`.
        2.  **Handling a Sensitive Check (`combatInvalidPitch`)**: Demonstrating the use of `flagOnly` for monitoring and a gentle escalation path.
        3.  **Item-Specific Violation (`worldIllegalItemUse`)**: Illustrating the use of `removeIllegalItem` and `freeze` actions.
*   **Ensured Clarity and Consistency**: Formatted the new examples to match the existing document style and provided clear explanations for each rule's logic.

**Outcome:** The `AutoModDetails.md` document is now more comprehensive, offering users advanced insights and practical examples for configuring sophisticated AutoMod rules tailored to various situations. This should empower admins to better manage automated moderation on their servers.

        *   Installation Issues
        *   Configuration Problems
        *   Commands Not Working

        *   General Tips
        *   Reporting Bugs Effectively
    *   Each section provides common problems and potential solutions.
*   **Updated `README.md`**:
    *   Modified the "Quick Troubleshooting Tip" collapsible section.
    *   Added a direct link to the newly created `Docs/Troubleshooting.md` for users seeking more detailed help.
    *   Refined the summary text of the troubleshooting tip section.
