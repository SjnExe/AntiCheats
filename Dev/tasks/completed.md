## Refactor `checkType` Identifiers, AutoMod Fixes, and Verifications (Session YYYY-MM-DD)

This large refactoring effort aimed to standardize `checkType` identifiers across the project to `camelCaseWithAcronyms` and resolve several related critical issues.

### 1. `checkType` Identifier Casing Convention & Refactoring
-   **Resolution**: Decision made to use `camelCaseWithAcronyms` for all `checkType` string identifiers.
-   **Impact**:
    -   `Dev/CodingStyle.md` was updated to specify `camelCaseWithAcronyms` for `checkType` string identifiers, including rules for acronym preservation (e.g., GMC, TPA).
    -   All relevant `checkType` keys and string literals were refactored in:
        -   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/actionProfiles.js` (object keys)
        -   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/automodConfig.js` (object keys in `automodRules` and `automodPerCheckTypeToggles`)
        -   All check scripts in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/checks/**/*.js` (string literals in `executeCheckAction` or `addFlag` calls)
        -   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/eventHandlers.js` (string literals in `executeCheckAction` or `addFlag` calls)
        -   `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/playerDataManager.js` (keys in the `flags` object of `initializeDefaultPlayerData`)

### 2. Critical AutoMod `actionType` Fix (`automodManager.js`)
-   **Issue**: The `switch (actionType)` in `_executeAutomodAction` in `automodManager.js` used `UPPERCASE` (e.g., `WARN`) for `case` conditions, while `automodConfig.js` (after its own refactor) defined `actionType`s in `camelCase` (e.g., `warn`). This would cause AutoMod actions to fail.
-   **Resolution**: The `case` conditions in `automodManager.js` were changed to `camelCase` (e.g., `case "warn":`, `case "tempBan":`) to match the values from `automodConfig.js`, fixing this critical issue for AutoMod functionality.

### 3. `chat_repeat_spam` Resolution & Consolidation
-   **Issue**: Ambiguity and potential misconfiguration regarding `chat_repeat_spam` and its handling.
-   **Resolution**:
    -   The call in `eventHandlers.js` for repeat spam checking (previously `checks.checkSpam` associated with `config.spamRepeatCheckEnabled`) was updated to correctly call `checks.checkMessageRate`. Arguments to `checkMessageRate` were also corrected.
    -   The `automodConfig.js` key `chat_repeat_spam` was removed from `automodRules` and `automodPerCheckTypeToggles`. Functionality is now consolidated under the `chatSpamFastMessage` checkType, which is handled by `checkMessageRate`.
    -   The default value for `fastMessageSPAMActionProfileName` in `config.js` was updated to the refactored `"chatSpamFastMessage"`.

### 4. 'example\_' `checkType` Refactoring
-   **Issue**: Placeholder `checkType`s like `"exampleSpeedGround"` and `"exampleReachAttack"` were used.
-   **Resolution**: These were refactored to more standard, descriptive names:
    -   `"exampleSpeedGround"` is now `"movementSpeedGround"`.
    -   `"exampleReachAttack"` is now `"combatReachAttack"`.
-   **Impact**: Changes were applied to the respective check files (`speedCheck.js`, `reachCheck.js`), `actionProfiles.js` (key renames), and `automodConfig.js` (key renames in `automodRules` and `automodPerCheckTypeToggles`).

### 5. World Border Pause/Resume Logic Verification
-   **Task**: Verify logic in `main.js` for pausing/resuming world border particle effects during resize operations.
-   **Resolution**: This logic was reviewed and confirmed to be functioning as intended. Particle effects should correctly pause during a world border resize and resume with the new border configuration once the resize is complete.
