- **Fix Script Crash on Startup:** Fixed a critical bug that caused a script crash during the addon's initialization. The issue was an incorrect import in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/dependencies.js`, where `ranks` was imported instead of the correctly named `rankDefinitions`. Resolved by aliasing the import (`import { rankDefinitions as ranks }`), ensuring compatibility with the rest of the codebase without requiring widespread changes. (Branch: `fix/import-crash`, completed by Jules)

- **(High) Bug Fix: Refactor to `tick.json` loop and fix runtime errors**
  - **Agent:** Jules
  - **Objectives:**
    - Re-architected the main tick loop to use the `functions/tick.json` method for better stability.
    - Removed the `system.runInterval` based loop.
    - Resolved the persistent `invalid player-like object` error by ensuring correct player object handling.
    - Ensured the addon is stable and functional in non-beta environments.
  - **Branch:** `fix/tick-json-loop` (self-assigned)
