## Task: Full Codebase Syntax and Standards Review (Completed by Jules)

**Date Completed:** (Filled by AI - Current Date)

**Work Done:**
*   Reviewed all JavaScript files within the `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/` directory, including subdirectories: `core/`, `checks/` (all sub-types), `commands/`, and `utils/`.
*   Identified and corrected JavaScript syntax issues (though most were stylistic or minor logical errors rather than parse errors).
*   Ensured adherence to project coding conventions as defined in `Dev/CodingStyle.md` and `Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md`. This included:
    *   Consistent variable and function naming (`camelCase`, `PascalCase` where appropriate).
    *   Standardized use of quotes, semicolons, spacing, and indentation (though actual auto-formatting was not performed, manual corrections were made to align).
    *   Ensured JSDoc comments were present and accurate for major functions and typedefs, correcting types and descriptions where necessary.
    *   Verified and corrected `actionType` and `checkType` string literals to be `camelCase` across configurations and function calls (e.g., in `actionProfiles.js`, `automodConfig.js`, and their usage in managers and checks).
    *   Improved error handling in various modules, ensuring errors are logged with sufficient context and stack traces where appropriate.
    *   Standardized API usage (e.g., `mc.EntityComponentTypes`, `mc.GameMode`).
    *   Refined logic in several check and command files for clarity, robustness, and correctness.
    *   Updated `textDatabase.js` with new keys for user-facing messages that were previously hardcoded or missing.
    *   Ensured player data (`pData`) modifications correctly set `isDirtyForSave = true;`.
    *   Added `player.isValid()` checks before operating on player objects, especially those received in event arguments or looked up by name.
    *   Implemented missing `updateConfigValue` function in `config.js`.
    *   Streamlined configuration in `automodConfig.js` by moving per-check enabled toggles into the main rule set definitions.
*   Used `overwrite_file_with_block` for applying file changes due to persistent issues with the diffing tool.
*   Updated `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md` at the start of the task.

**Submission Reference:**
*   Branch Name (to be filled by user/system upon submission, e.g., `fix/codebase-review-jules`)
*   Commit Message Theme: "Fix: Full codebase syntax and standards review."
