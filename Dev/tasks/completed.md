## Task: Fix `ReferenceError: Import [modules/core/textDatabase.js] not found`
- **Agent:** Jules
- **Date:** 2025-07-31
- **Summary:** Fixed a critical scripting error caused by an incorrect import path in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/modules/utils/playerUtils.js`. The import for `textDatabase.js` was changed from `../core/textDatabase.js` to the correct `../../core/textDatabase.js`. This resolved the `ReferenceError` that was preventing the plugin from loading correctly.
- **Submission:** Branch `fix/textdatabase-import`.
