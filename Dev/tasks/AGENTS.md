# Agent Instructions for Task Management (Dev/tasks/)

This document provides guidelines for maintaining the task management files within the `Dev/tasks/` directory: `todo.md`, `ongoing.md`, and `completed.md`.

**These instructions apply to AI agents and human developers collaborating on this project.** Consistent task tracking is crucial for project clarity and progress.

## Task Management Workflow:

1.  **Adding New Tasks:**
    *   All new tasks, ideas, or bugs should initially be added to `Dev/tasks/todo.md`.
    *   Use Markdown bullet points (`- ` or `* `).
    *   Prefix tasks with a priority indicator if known:
        *   `(High)`: Critical tasks, blockers.
        *   `(Medium)`: Important tasks, regular features/bugs.
        *   `(Low)`: Minor tasks, enhancements, documentation.
    *   Provide a concise but clear description of the task.
    *   If the task relates to a specific file or line number, include that as context (e.g., `(Context: README.md:2)`).

2.  **Starting a Task:**
    *   When a task is selected to be worked on, move it from `Dev/tasks/todo.md` to `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md`.
    *   Remove the task entry from `todo.md`.
    *   Add the task entry to `ongoing.md`.
    *   It's helpful to add your name or the agent's identifier next to the task in `ongoing.md`.

3.  **Completing a Task:**
    *   Once a task is finished and verified (e.g., code committed, changes tested), move it from `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md` to `Dev/tasks/completed.md`.
    *   Remove the task entry from `ongoing.md`.
    *   Add the task entry to `completed.md`.
    *   Consider adding a completion date or a link to the relevant commit/PR in `completed.md` for future reference, though this is optional.

4.  **Pausing or Deferring a Task:**
    *   If an ongoing task is paused, blocked, or deferred, move it from `Dev/tasks/ongoing.md` back to `Dev/tasks/todo.md`.
    *   Remove the task entry from `ongoing.md`.
    *   Add the task entry back to `todo.md`, ensuring its priority and description are still accurate.

## General Guidelines:

*   **Keep it Updated:** Regularly review and update these files to reflect the current state of development.
*   **Clarity is Key:** Write task descriptions that are easy to understand.
*   **One Task, One Place:** A task should only exist in one of the three files at any given time.
*   **`todo.md` Structure:** `todo.md` can be organized with subheadings (e.g., `## Documentation Tasks`, `## Bug Fixes`) for better readability if the list becomes long.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain an effective and transparent task management system.
