# Analysis of SafeGuard and Scythe-Anticheat Addons

This document provides a detailed analysis of two open-source Minecraft Bedrock anti-cheat addons: SafeGuard and Scythe-Anticheat. The goal of this analysis is to identify best practices and potential features that can be incorporated into our own addon.

## 1. SafeGuard Analysis

### Overview

SafeGuard is a comprehensive anti-cheat addon for Minecraft Bedrock that focuses on detecting combat, item, and movement hacks. It uses a combination of JavaScript-based checks and in-game commands to provide a robust security solution.

### Key Features

*   **Cheat Detections:**
    *   **Combat:** High CPS, Multi Killaura, Combat Log.
    *   **Movement:** Fly, Invalid Velocity.
    *   **World:** Nuker, Scaffold, Illegal Item Place, Anti Namespoof.
    *   **Chat:** Spam, Same Message, Short Timed Messages.
*   **Admin Panel:** An in-game UI, accessible via a special item (`safeguard:admin_panel`), allows administrators to manage the addon's settings, ban/unban players, and view logs.
*   **Command System:** A chat-based command system with a configurable prefix (`!`) provides additional administrative capabilities.
*   **Configuration:** A `config.js` file allows for fine-tuning of various features, such as setting thresholds for cheat detection, defining banned items, and customizing punishments.
*   **Data Persistence:** The addon uses dynamic properties to store data that needs to persist across server restarts, such as bans, mutes, and configuration changes.

### Initialization and Architecture

*   **Entry Point:** `scripts/index.js`
*   **Initialization:** The addon is initialized when the first player spawns or when the world is reloaded. The `Initialize()` function in `scripts/initialize.js` handles the setup of scoreboard objectives, migration of legacy data, and loading of configuration from dynamic properties.
*   **Architecture:** The architecture is event-driven, with most of the logic contained within the `scripts/index.js` file. This file subscribes to various server-side events and runs a main game loop using `system.runInterval` for continuous checks.

## 2. Scythe-Anticheat Analysis

### Overview

Scythe-Anticheat is another popular anti-cheat addon for Minecraft Bedrock, known for its extensive and granular cheat detections. It has a strong focus on stability and user-friendly configuration.

### Key Features

*   **Cheat Detections:**
    *   **Combat:** AutoClicker, Killaura (multiple checks), Reach.
    *   **Movement:** InvalidSprint, NoSlow.
    *   **World:** InstaBreak, Nuker, Scaffold (multiple checks).
    *   **Inventory:** AutoOffhand, AutoTool, InventoryMods.
    *   **Packets:** BadPackets (multiple checks for invalid data).
    *   **Chat:** Spammer (multiple checks).
*   **Configuration Migration:** A standout feature is the automatic configuration migration system in `scripts/loader.js`, which ensures that older configurations are compatible with newer versions of the addon.
*   **Granular Configuration:** The `scripts/data/config.js` file provides detailed options for each cheat detection, including `enabled`, `punishment` type, `punishmentLength`, and `minVlbeforePunishment`.
*   **UI and Commands:** It features an extensive command system with tag-based permissions and a UI that can be accessed with a special item.
*   **Stability:** It includes a watchdog handler (`system.beforeEvents.watchdogTerminate`) to prevent the server from crashing due to script timeouts.

### Initialization and Architecture

*   **Entry Point:** `scripts/loader.js`
*   **Initialization:** The `loader.js` file handles the initialization process, including loading and migrating the configuration, initializing dynamic properties, and loading other modules.
*   **Architecture:** The code is well-organized and modular. The `loader.js` file is responsible for loading all other components, including command handlers, class extensions, and the main anticheat logic in `scripts/main.js`. This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable and scalable.

## 3. Comparison of SafeGuard and Scythe-Anticheat

| Feature | SafeGuard | Scythe-Anticheat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initialization** | Basic initialization on first spawn/reload. Loads config from dynamic properties. | Advanced loader with configuration migration system. |
| **Configuration** | Good, but less granular than Scythe. | Very detailed and flexible, with per-module punishment settings. |
| **Cheat Detections** | Good coverage of common cheats. | More extensive and specific detections, with multiple checks for the same cheat. |
| **Code Structure** | Good, but a bit monolithic in `index.js`. | Excellent, with clear separation of concerns and use of extensions. |
| **Updates & Migration**| No built-in migration system for configs. | Robust configuration migration system to handle updates. |
| **Stability** | No explicit stability features observed. | Includes a watchdog handler to prevent script-related crashes. |
| **UI** | Has an admin panel item. | Has a UI item and a more extensive UI system. |
| **Commands** | Good set of admin commands. | Very extensive command system with tag-based permissions. |

## 4. Recommendations for Our Addon

Based on the analysis of these two addons, here is a list of recommendations for improving our own addon:

1.  **Implement a Configuration Migration System:** Adopt a system similar to Scythe's `loader.js` to automatically update user configurations when the addon is updated. This will greatly improve the user experience and reduce issues caused by outdated configs.
2.  **Enhance Configuration Granularity:** For each cheat detection module, allow users to configure not just whether it's enabled, but also the specific punishment (e.g., "none", "kick", "ban"), the duration of the punishment, and the violation level required to trigger the punishment.
3.  **Refactor the Codebase for Modularity:**
    *   Create a dedicated `loader.js` or `main.js` as the primary entry point to handle initialization and module loading.
    *   Separate command handlers, cheat detections, and utility functions into their own modules/files.
    *   Use class extensions to add custom methods to the standard Minecraft `Player` and `Entity` classes, making the code cleaner and more object-oriented.
4.  **Improve Cheat Detection Specificity:** Instead of general checks, create more specific and targeted detections. For example, instead of a single "killaura" check, implement separate checks for multi-aura, no-swing attacks, and attacking while using items.
5.  **Add a Watchdog Handler:** Implement a `system.beforeEvents.watchdogTerminate` event listener to prevent the server from crashing due to script timeouts, enhancing stability.
6.  **Expand the Command System:** Add more utility commands, such as `invsee`, `vanish`, and detailed `stats`, and implement a flexible permission system using tags.
7.  **Develop a More Advanced UI:** Create a more comprehensive UI that allows admins to not only toggle modules but also edit configuration values directly in-game, similar to what SafeGuard offers but with the granularity of Scythe's configuration.
8.  **Implement a Robust Flagging and Violation System:** Create a centralized `flag()` function that records violations for each player. This allows for more sophisticated punishment systems where actions are taken only after a player accumulates a certain number of violations.
