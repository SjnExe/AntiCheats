**Files Proposed for Deletion and Reasons:**

1.  **`Dev/CommandDevelopmentNotes.md`**:
    *   Reason: Contains notes on command prefixes. This information is likely outdated, integrated into `CodingStyle.md`, or has become standard practice.

2.  **`Dev/notes/AutoModReview_Findings.md`**:
    *   Reason: Dated July 29, 2024. The `Dev/tasks/completed.md` file indicates significant AutoMod work and refactoring occurred after this date, likely making these findings outdated.

3.  **`Dev/KillauraAimbotInvestigation.md`**:
    *   Reason: An investigation note. If the investigation is concluded and relevant findings are integrated or documented elsewhere (e.g. in `completed.md` or in the code itself), this might be historical.

4.  **`Dev/PersistenceInvestigation.md`**:
    *   Reason: Similar to the Killaura investigation, this could be an outdated historical note.

5.  **`Dev/notes/BlockSpamDetectionStrategy.md`**:
    *   Reason: A strategy document. If these strategies have been implemented, superseded, or documented elsewhere, this may no longer be needed.

6.  **`Dev/notes/ChatInContainerUI_Investigation.md`**:
    *   Reason: An investigation note. Could be historical if the investigation concluded.

7.  **`Dev/notes/DeviceBanInvestigation.md`**:
    *   Reason: An investigation note. Could be historical.

8.  **`Dev/notes/EntitySpamDetectionStrategy.md`**:
    *   Reason: A strategy document. Similar to block spam, it might be outdated.

9.  **`Dev/notes/PacketAnomalyResearch.md`**:
    *   Reason: `Dev/tasks/completed.md` mentions that findings were documented here after research. If these findings have been absorbed into development tasks or other more permanent documentation, this note might be redundant.

10. **`Dev/notes/WorldBorderDesign.md`**:
    *   Reason: `Dev/tasks/completed.md` indicates the world border logic was verified. This design document might now be historical.

11. **All files in `Dev/tests/`**:
    *   `AntiGriefBlockSpamTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefEntitySpamTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefFireTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefLavaTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefWaterTests.md`
    *   `AntiGriefWitherTests.md`
    *   Reason: These are Markdown files for manual test plans. If these tests are now automated, or if the features have changed significantly, rendering these plans obsolete, they can be removed.
