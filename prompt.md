Hello Jules,

I need your help with a documentation review and refactoring task for a Minecraft Bedrock addon.

**Background:**
This project was just rebranded from an addon called "AntiCheats" to a more general-purpose utility called "AddonExe". A large, mostly automated search-and-replace was performed across the entire repository to change all instances of "AntiCheats", "Anti Cheats", "AC", etc., to "AddonExe", "Addon Exe", "EXE", etc.

**The Problem:**
While the renaming is functionally complete, the direct word swap has likely left the documentation sounding awkward, clunky, or grammatically incorrect in places. For example, a heading like "Why Choose This AntiCheat?" might now read "Why Choose This AddonExe?", which isn't ideal.

**Your Task:**
Your mission is to act as a technical writer and editor. Please review all user-facing documentation and improve its readability and flow in light of the new "AddonExe" branding. The goal is to make the documentation read as if it were written for "AddonExe" from the start.

**Scope of Work:**
1.  **Review the following files:**
    *   The root `README.md`
    *   All files within the `Docs/` directory (`Commands.md`, `ConfigurationGuide.md`, `FeaturesOverview.md`, `RankSystem.md`, `Troubleshooting.md`).
2.  **Refactor for Readability and Professionalism:**
    *   Correct any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that resulted from the automated renaming.
    *   Rewrite sentences or headings to sound more natural. For example, instead of "Why Choose This AddonExe?", you might change it to "Why Choose AddonExe?". Instead of "AntiCheats Addon Version", it should be "AddonExe Version".
    *   Ensure the tone is consistent and the documentation is clear, polished, and easy for a new user to understand.
3.  **Important Note:** Please **ignore** the `OldAntiCheatsBP/` and `OldAntiCheatsRP/` directories. They are being kept as a historical reference and should not be modified.

Please start by exploring the `README.md` and the `Docs/` directory to understand the current state of the documentation, and then create a plan to tackle the refactoring. Thank you!
