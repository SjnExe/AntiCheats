 * Registers a new command for the command handler.
 *
 * @param {object} obj - The command configuration object.
 * @param {string} obj.name - The unique name of the command. This is how the command will be identified internally and typically invoked (before aliasing).
 * @param {string} obj.description - A brief description of what the command does. This is used in help commands. If not provided, a default message is logged and used.
 * @param {function(object): void} obj.run - The function to execute when the command is called. This function will receive an object containing `args` (array of command arguments including command name), `player` (the player object who executed the command), and `message` (the raw message string). For the 'help' command, it also receives `commandsData`.
 * @param {boolean} [obj.disabled=false] - If true, the command will not be registered. Defaults to false.
 * @param {boolean} [obj.adminOnly=true] - If true, only players with admin privileges (checked via `player.hasAdmin()`) can execute the command. Defaults to true.
 * @param {boolean} [obj.ownerOnly=false] - If true, only the player designated as the owner (checked via `player.isOwner()`) can execute the command. This typically overrides `adminOnly`. Defaults to false.
 * @throws {TypeError} If the `obj` parameter is not an object.
 * @returns {void} Logs an error if a command with the same name already exists or if the description is missing, but does not throw an error for these cases.
