# Rank and Permission System

This addon features a flexible rank system to grant permissions and customize player appearances (chat and nametags). This guide explains how the system works, from basic setup to advanced customization.

## How Ranks and Permissions Work

The system is designed with a clear hierarchy:

1.  **`config.js` is for Quick Setup:** You can set up your server's owners and admins in seconds by editing this one file.
2.  **`ranksConfig.js` is for Advanced Customization:** This file controls the properties of *all* ranks, including their names, permission levels, and visual styles. You edit this file if you want to add new ranks (like "Moderator" or "VIP") or change how existing ranks look.

## 1. Quick Setup (`config.js`)

This is the fastest way to manage your server's staff roles.

- **File:** `AddonExeBP/scripts/config.js`

### Set Server Owner(s)
- **What it does:** The `ownerPlayerNames` array grants the highest permission level (0) to the listed players.
- **Action:** Add the **exact** in-game names of all owners to this array.
- **➡️ For a summary, see the [F.A.Q.](F.A.Q.md#how-do-i-change-the-server-owner)**

### Set Server Admin(s)
- **What it does:** The `adminTag` setting grants the Admin permission level (1) to any player with that tag.
- **Action:** To make someone an admin, give them the tag: `/tag "PlayerName" add admin`.

## 2. Advanced Customization (`ranksConfig.js`)

Edit this file only if you want to create new ranks or change the appearance (colors, prefixes) of the default ranks.

- **File:** `AddonExeBP/scripts/core/ranksConfig.js`

This file contains the `rankDefinitions` array. Each object in this array is a rank.

### Rank Properties

- `id` (string): A unique, lowercase identifier (e.g., "owner", "vip").
- `name` (string): The user-friendly display name (e.g., "Owner", "VIP").
- `permissionLevel` (number): Determines power. **Lower numbers are more powerful** (Owner=0, Admin=1, Member=1024).
- `chatFormatting` (object): Controls how chat messages look.
- `nametagPrefix` (string): The text that appears above a player's head.
- `conditions` (array): The rules that assign a player to this rank.

### How Conditions Work

The `conditions` array tells the addon who should get the rank.
- The `Owner` rank has a condition `{ type: 'ownerName' }`, which automatically links it to the `ownerPlayerNames` list in `config.js`.
- The `Admin` rank has `{ type: 'adminTag' }`, linking it to the `adminTag` in `config.js`.
- The `Member` rank has `{ type: 'default' }`, making it the fallback for everyone else.

### Example: Adding a "Moderator" Rank

To add a new "Moderator" rank, you would add a new object to the `rankDefinitions` array in `ranksConfig.js`:

```javascript
// In AddonExeBP/scripts/core/ranksConfig.js
export const rankDefinitions = [
    // ... Owner and Admin ranks are here ...

    {
        id: 'moderator',
        name: 'Moderator',
        permissionLevel: 100, // Less powerful than Admin (1) but more than Member (1024)
        chatFormatting: {
            prefixText: '§8[§2Mod§8] ',
            nameColor: '§a',
            messageColor: '§f'
        },
        nametagPrefix: '§2Mod §f\n',
        conditions: [
            { type: 'tag', tag: 'moderator' } // Assign this rank to players with the 'moderator' tag
        ]
    },

    // ... Member rank is here ...
];
```
To assign this new rank, you would use the command: `/tag "PlayerName" add moderator`.

### Rank Precedence

If a player meets the conditions for multiple ranks (e.g., they have both an "admin" tag and a "moderator" tag), the rank with the **lowest `permissionLevel` number** will always be used.
