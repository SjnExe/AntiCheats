# Security Policy

The AntiCheats Addon team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to address them in a timely manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities using one of the following methods:

1.  **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred):** If you have a GitHub account, you can privately report a vulnerability directly on GitHub. This is the most secure and preferred method. Go to the "Security" tab of the [AntiCheats repository](https://github.com/SjnExe/AntiCheats) and click on "Report a vulnerability." This will allow you to submit a detailed report directly to the project maintainers.

2.  **Email:** If you prefer, you can send an email to `sjnexecontact@gmail.com`. Please use a clear subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability Report: AntiCheats Addon".

## What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the issue effectively:

*   **Type of vulnerability:** (e.g., Remote Code Execution, Data Exposure, Denial of Service, Bypass of a specific check)
*   **Description of the vulnerability:** A clear explanation of the issue and its potential impact.
*   **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability. This may include specific configurations, commands, or interactions.
*   **Affected version(s):** Specify which version(s) of the AntiCheats Addon are affected. If possible, test against the latest release.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** If possible, provide a simple PoC (code, commands, or a detailed explanation) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   **Your name or alias for acknowledgment (optional):** Let us know if you'd like to be credited for your discovery.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability to us:

1.  **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48-72 hours.
2.  **Investigation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability to understand its scope and impact. We may contact you if we need further information.
3.  **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix as quickly as possible. The timeline for a fix will depend on the complexity and severity of the issue.
4.  **Disclosure:** Once a fix is available and has been deployed (e.g., in a new release), we may publicly disclose the vulnerability, often with credit to the reporter (if requested). The timing and details of public disclosure will be coordinated to minimize risk.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the AntiCheats Addon itself. If you find a vulnerability in Minecraft Bedrock Edition or any third-party libraries used by the addon, please report it to the respective maintainers.
