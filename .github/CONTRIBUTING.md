## Code Contributions

We are excited to receive code contributions! If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these guidelines.

### Setting Up Your Environment

Details on setting up a development environment can be found in our [Addon Development Resources](Dev/README.md). (This may include information on required software, project structure, and build processes if applicable).

### Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the [SjnExe/AddonExe](https://github.com/SjnExe/AddonExe) repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a dedicated branch on your fork. Branch names should be descriptive (e.g., `fix/fly-detection-exploit`, `feature/new-reporting-ui`).
3.  **Develop:** Make your code changes, adhering to the project's coding standards.
4.  **Test:** Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new issues or regressions.
5.  **Document:** Update any relevant documentation in the `Docs/` folder or JSDoc comments if your changes affect user-facing features or complex code logic.
6.  **Commit:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.
7.  **Push:** Push your changes to your fork.
8.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch (or the relevant development branch) of the `SjnExe/AddonExe` repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes you've made and why.
    *   Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").

### Coding Standards

Please follow our [**Coding Style Guide**](Dev/CodingStyle.md) and [**Standardization Guidelines**](Dev/StandardizationGuidelines.md). This includes conventions for naming, formatting, JSDoc comments, and error handling. Adherence to these standards helps maintain code quality and consistency.

Key points:
*   All Behavior Pack scripts are written in plain JavaScript (ES6+ features as supported by Minecraft's engine). Do not use TypeScript syntax.
*   Pay close attention to all naming conventions (including for `checkType` and `actionType` identifiers, which must be `camelCase`), formatting, JSDoc practices, and error handling as detailed in these guides.

### Testing

Ensure your changes are stable and do not introduce new issues. Test your changes in-game under various conditions. If you are fixing a bug, include steps on how to reproduce the bug and verify the fix. If you are adding a new feature, test its functionality thoroughly.

(Placeholder: If specific testing frameworks or procedures are established, they will be detailed here or in `Dev/README.md`.)

### Documentation

If you add or modify features, please update the relevant documentation:
*   **User-facing features:** Update or add pages in the `Docs/` folder (e.g., `FeaturesOverview.md`, `Commands.md`, `ConfigurationGuide.md`).
*   **Code changes:** Ensure JSDoc comments for new or modified functions are clear, accurate, and follow project standards.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers.
2.  Be prepared to discuss your changes and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.
3.  Once your PR is approved and passes any automated checks (if applicable), it will be merged.

We appreciate your patience during the review process!
