## üöÄ Quick Start & Setup

Get up and running in minutes!

1. **Download:** Grab the latest `.mcaddon` from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/SjnExe/AntiCheats/releases).
2. **Install:** Apply both `AntiCheatsBP` (Behavior Pack) and `AntiCheatsRP` (Resource Pack) to your world.
3. **Enable Beta APIs (CRITICAL!):**
   - In your world settings, go to the "Experiments" section.
   - **Enable the "Beta APIs" toggle.** This addon relies on beta Minecraft Scripting API features and will not function correctly without this setting enabled.
4. **Initialize the Addon (CRITICAL!):**
   - Once in your world, run the command `/function ac`.
   - This command initializes the addon and sets up necessary components. It must be run for the AntiCheat to work.
5. **Prioritize:** Ensure `AntiCheatsBP` is at the **TOP** of your behavior pack list. This is crucial for the AntiCheat to function correctly.
6. **üëë Set Owner (CRUCIAL!):**
   - Access the addon files. If you downloaded the `.mcaddon`, you may need to rename it to `.zip` to extract the contents.
   - Open `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` in a text editor.
   - Set `ownerPlayerName` to your **exact** in-game name (case-sensitive).
   - **Failure to set an owner will result in no player having administrative permissions**, making it impossible to manage the addon.
7. **üéÆ Explore:** Join your world and type `!panel` (or `!ui`) to open the Admin UI.
8. **üîß Configure (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Review `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` for other core settings (like the command `prefix`).
   - For detailed setup and advanced options, visit our [**Setup and Configuration Guide**](Docs/ConfigurationGuide.md).

<summary><strong>üí° Quick Troubleshooting Tips & Full Guide</strong></summary>

Common quick checks:

- **Enable "Beta APIs":** Make sure the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle is ON in your world settings. This addon requires it.
- Ensure `AntiCheatsBP` is at the very top of your behavior packs.
- Verify your `ownerPlayerName` in `config.js` is exact (case-sensitive).
- Check Minecraft version compatibility (see badge above).
- Test for conflicts with other addons, especially those modifying player behavior.

## Performance Considerations

This addon is designed to be as lightweight as possible. However, performance can be influenced by the number of checks enabled, their sensitivity, and the server's player count. We recommend starting with default configurations and adjusting based on your server's needs.

For developers, the addon includes a basic performance profiling feature that can be enabled in `config.js` to help identify potential bottlenecks. For more details, see the [**Developer README**](Dev/README.md).
