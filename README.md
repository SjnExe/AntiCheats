# Anti-Cheats Addon

This addon utilizes advanced scripting capabilities to provide robust anti-cheat functionalities for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, aiming to detect and alert administrators to common cheating behaviors.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1.  **Download:** Get the latest version from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/placeholder_username/placeholder_repo/releases). Look for the `.mcaddon` file.
2.  **Install:** Apply both the Behavior Pack (`AntiCheatsBP`) and Resource Pack (`AntiCheatsRP`) to your Minecraft world.
3.  **Prioritize:** Ensure the Behavior Pack is at the **top** of the pack list if you have multiple behavior packs active.
4.  **Set Owner (Crucial):**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set your in-game name as `ownerPlayerName` in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js` to gain full owner permissions. This step is vital for full control over the addon.
5.  **Explore:** Join your world and type `!panel` (or `!ui`) in chat to open the admin interface.
6.  **Configure (Optional):** Other key settings like admin tags and command prefix are also in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.

For more details on specific systems, see the linked documentation pages.

## Installation

1.  **Download:** Obtain the addon pack (usually an `.mcaddon` file) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/placeholder_username/placeholder_repo/releases).
2.  **Apply Packs:** Apply both the Behavior Pack (`AntiCheatsBP`) and Resource Pack (`AntiCheatsRP`) to your Minecraft world.
3.  **Prioritize Behavior Pack:** Ensure the Behavior Pack is at the **top** of the behavior pack list if you have multiple packs active. This is crucial for compatibility.
4.  **Initial Configuration:** Follow step 4 in the [ðŸš€ Quick Start](#-quick-start) section to set the `ownerPlayerName`. Also, ensure trusted admins have the appropriate `adminTag` (default: `"admin"`) as defined in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.

## Basic Usage & Commands

The default command prefix is `!` (configurable in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`).
*   The primary way to interact with the addon as an admin is via the **`!panel`** (or `!ui`) command, which opens a comprehensive UI.
*   For a detailed list of all text-based commands for both administrators and players, including syntax and permissions, please refer to our complete [Commands Guide](Docs/Commands.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can quickly get help for any command by typing `!help <command_name>` in the chat if you know the command, or `!help` to list commands available to you.

## Configuration Overview

The main configuration for this addon is centralized in **[`AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`](AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js)**. This file allows you to customize:
*   Core settings (command prefix, language, global feature toggles).
*   Cheat detection sensitivity and thresholds.
*   General behavior for systems like AutoMod and World Border.

While `config.js` is the primary hub, it may reference other specialized files for more detailed settings, such as [`AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/actionProfiles.js`](AntiCheatsBP/scripts/core/actionProfiles.js) for defining specific detection responses.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed setup and advanced configuration for complex systems like Automated Moderation and the World Border are found in their respective documentation files within the `Docs/` directory. Consult these for in-depth guidance.
