## üöÄ Installation & Setup

We recommend the following manual installation method, as it makes future configuration much easier.

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest `.mcaddon` file from our [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/SjnExe/AddonExe/releases).
2.  **Extract the Packs (Recommended Method):**
    - Do **not** open the `.mcaddon` file directly. Instead, rename it to end in `.zip` (e.g., `AddonExe.mcaddon` -> `AddonExe.zip`).
    - Unzip the file. Inside, you will find two folders: `AddonExeBP` (the Behavior Pack) and `AddonExeRP` (the Resource Pack).
    - Move these two folders into your Minecraft's development packs folders (`development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs`).
    > **Why this method?** Installing the folders directly makes it simple to find and edit the `config.js` file later. Installing a sealed `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` makes configuration much more difficult.
3.  **Apply to Your World:**
    - Open Minecraft and go to your world's settings.
    - Apply both `AddonExeBP` and `AddonExeRP` to your world.
4.  **Enable World Settings (CRITICAL!):**
    - In your world settings, go to the "Game" section and enable **"Activate Cheats"**. This is required for slash commands to work.
    - Next, go to the "Experiments" section and **enable the "Beta APIs" toggle.** This addon relies on beta Minecraft Scripting API features and will not function without this setting enabled.
5.  **Prioritize:** Ensure `AddonExeBP` is at the **TOP** of your behavior pack list in the world settings. This is crucial for AddonExe to function correctly.
6.  **üëë Set Owner(s) (CRUCIAL!):**
    - Now that you've installed the folders, navigate to `development_behavior_packs/AddonExeBP/scripts/` and open `config.js` in a text editor.
    - Find the `ownerPlayerNames` setting.
    - Add your **exact** in-game name (case-sensitive) to the array. You can add multiple owner names.
      ```javascript
      // Example in AddonExeBP/scripts/config.js
      ownerPlayerNames: ['YourNameHere', 'AnotherOwnerName'],
      ```
    - **Failure to set at least one owner will result in no player having administrative permissions.**
7.  **üéÆ Explore:** Join your world and open the Admin UI. Admins can get the panel item directly by typing `/panel`. Any player can also craft the item using a single stick.
8.  **üîß Configure (Optional but Recommended):**
    - Review `AddonExeBP/scripts/config.js` for other core settings (like the chat command `prefix`).
    - For detailed setup and advanced options, visit our [**Setup and Configuration Guide**](Docs/ConfigurationGuide.md).

<summary><strong>üí° Quick Troubleshooting Tips & Full Guide</strong></summary>

Common quick checks:

- **Enable Cheats & Beta APIs:** Make sure both "Activate Cheats" and the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle are ON in your world settings.
- Ensure `AddonExeBP` is at the very top of your behavior packs.
- Verify you have added your exact, case-sensitive name to the `ownerPlayerNames` array in `config.js`.
- Check Minecraft version compatibility (see badge above).
- Test for conflicts with other addons, especially those modifying player behavior.

## Performance Considerations

This addon is designed to be as lightweight as possible. However, performance can be influenced by the number of checks enabled, their sensitivity, and the server's player count. We recommend starting with default configurations and adjusting based on your server's needs.

For developers, the addon includes a basic performance profiling feature that can be enabled in `config.js` to help identify potential bottlenecks. For more details, see the [**Developer README**](Dev/README.md).
