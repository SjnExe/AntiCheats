## üöÄ Quick Start & Setup

Get up and running in minutes!

1. **Download:** Grab the latest `.mcaddon` from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/SjnExe/AntiCheats/releases).
2. **Install:** Apply both `AntiCheatsBP` (Behavior Pack) and `AntiCheatsRP` (Resource Pack) to your world.
3. **Enable Beta APIs (CRITICAL!):**
   - In your world settings, go to the "Experiments" section.
   - **Enable the "Beta APIs" toggle.** This addon relies on beta Minecraft Scripting API features (as specified in its `manifest.json`) and will not function correctly with all features without this setting enabled.
4. **Initialize the Addon (CRITICAL!):**
   - Once in your world, run the command `/function ac`.
   - This command initializes the addon, sets up necessary components, and must be run for the AntiCheat to work.
5. **Prioritize:** Ensure `AntiCheatsBP` is at the **TOP** of your behavior pack list. This is crucial for the AntiCheat to function correctly.
6. **üëë Set Owner (CRUCIAL!):**
   - Open `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`. (Note: `.mcaddon` files are zip archives; you may need to rename to `.zip` or use an archive tool to access the contents if editing manually.)
   - Set `ownerPlayerName` to your **exact** in-game name (case-sensitive). This grants you full control!
7. **üéÆ Explore:** Join your world and type `!panel` (or `!ui`) to open the Admin UI.
8. **üîß Configure (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Review other core settings (admin tag, command prefix, etc.) in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.
   - Explore the in-game settings panel (`!panel`) for more specific check configurations.
   - For detailed setup and advanced options, visit our [**Setup and Configuration Guide**](Docs/ConfigurationGuide.md).

<summary><strong>üí° Quick Troubleshooting Tips & Full Guide</strong></summary>

Common quick checks:

- **Enable "Beta APIs":** Make sure the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle is ON in your world settings. This addon requires it.
- Ensure `AntiCheatsBP` is at the very top of your behavior packs.
- Verify your `ownerPlayerName` in `config.js` is exact (case-sensitive).
- Check Minecraft version compatibility (see badge above).
- Test for conflicts with other addons, especially those modifying player behavior.

## Performance Considerations & Profiling

This addon is designed to be as lightweight as possible. However, like any complex system:

- The number of checks enabled and their sensitivity can influence server performance.
- Very high player counts on servers with limited resources might see a slight impact.

We recommend starting with default configurations and adjusting based on your server's specific needs and performance characteristics.

**Performance Profiling:**
To help identify potential bottlenecks, the addon includes a basic performance profiling feature.

- **Enable:** Set `enablePerformanceProfiling: true` in `AntiCheatsBP/scripts/config.js`.
- **Logging:** When enabled, aggregated performance data for the main tick loop, individual checks, and event handlers will be logged periodically to the server console/logs (via `playerUtils.debugLog` with a `PerformanceProfile` tag).
- **Usage:** This data can help developers pinpoint specific areas that might be consuming more resources than expected. It's recommended to only enable this for temporary debugging sessions, as continuous profiling can itself have a minor performance overhead.
- **Configuration:** The logging interval can be adjusted with `logPerformanceProfileIntervalTicks` in the config.
